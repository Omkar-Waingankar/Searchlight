For 7 years, we have told the American people that we would repeal ObamaCare and replace it with something better, and we have legislation that provides that opportunity. It is not a perfect bill--no bill is. But President Trump has said this is our best and only chance to get this done.  The bill cuts taxes by hundreds of billions of dollars and reduces government by hundreds of billions, too. It keeps preexisting condition prohibitions and lets 26-year-olds stay on their parents' health care. But most importantly, it unshackles American families from government-forced mandates costing them hundreds of thousands of dollars each year. Simply put, it is an enormous improvement over the status quo.  My hope is we will be back next week before I know many of my colleagues are ready for the holidays, but we need to do what we said we would do: repeal ObamaCare and replace it with something better.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-06-pt1-PgH2768-4.txt,CREC-2017-04-06-pt1-PgH2768-4.xml,OUR WORK ON HEALTH CARE IS UNDONE,2017,4,6

6,RUSSELL,2265,proceeding_id,topic_id,2090,"Mr.Speaker, today, exactly 100 years ago, on this very floor, the United States declared war on Imperial Germany and entered the First World War on the side of the The decisions that led to that monumental declaration forever changed America's destiny, economy, military, foreign policy, and culture.  Today also marks the beginning of our National Centennial remembrance of America's service in World War I for the sacrifices made by all Americans and for the more than one-quarter of a million American casualties, including over 100,000 dead, most of whom were lost in a mere 6-month period from May to November 1918.  By the war's end, my great-grandfather and his three brothers would all serve. My great-grandfather's brother, my great-uncle, Frank Chamberlain, was killed in action. This is his pipe that he was carrying when he was killed in France, his dog tags, and his uniform insignia that I was able to inherit from my great-grandfather.  He lays peacefully in France under a white marble military gravestone, a scant, faceless hint of the man who was once filled with laughter and humor, who held dreams, hopes, and goals for the future. Frank was 19 years old.  On April 6, 1917, our country was forever changed, and it began right here on this very floor. It is only fitting, Mr.Speaker, that we give remembrance to its beginning here today. I am indeed indebted to the fine work of Eric Setzekorn of the United States Army's Center of Military History for his material from ``Joining the Great War,'' which forms the basis for today's remembrance.       After the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of      Austria on the 28th of June 1914, which led to the military      mobilization across Europe and declarations of war by early      August, most Americans took solace that the Atlantic Ocean      shielded the United States from the conflict. The Chicago      Herald summed up the popular support for isolation from      Europe's strife in its article that said: ``Peace-loving      citizens of this country will now rise up and tender a hearty      vote of thanks to Columbus for having discovered America.''       Germany's invasion of neutral Belgium brought Great Britain      into the war and divided Europe into two great camps. Britain      joined France and Russia to form the Triple Entente, more      commonly referred to as the Allied Opposed to them      were Germany and Austria-Hungary, making up the Central            President Woodrow Wilson believed that the immoral nature      of European politics created entangling alliances that      transformed a regional conflict into a global war that      threatened world peace. The President delivered a Declaration      of Neutrality to this very Congress on the 19th of August      1914, calling on all citizens to remain ``impartial in      thought, as well as in action.'' However, between late 1914      and early 1917, the escalating conflict tested American      traditions of isolationism as it threatened to draw the      Nation closer to the war.       The initial German offensive against France ended in      September at the Battle of the Marne, after which both sides      attempted a series of flanking maneuvers to gain the      advantage. Neither side proved capable of overcoming the      killing power that machine guns and rapid-firing artillery      brought to the defensive, and the battle lines all along the      Western Front stabilized in a vast system of trenches      stretching from Switzerland all the way to the English      This was a new type of warfare, with soldiers      subjected to prolonged stress and danger, with little chance      for daring heroics or martial glory.       Behind the trenches, the development of sophisticated      supply systems that were able to support millions of men and      massive levels of firepower and the ability to rush reserves      to block any potential enemy breakthrough led to a vicious      stalemate.       On the broad expanses of the Eastern Front, Germany and      Austria were locked in a brutal war of attrition with Russia,      where logistics and artillery shells counted far more than      bravery.       To break through the deadlock, the combatants attempted to      smash through enemy[[Page H2778]]     lines with ever larger offensives. Attacks in 1915 saw tens      of thousands of soldiers and hundreds of artillery pieces      deployed along only a few miles of the front, trying to win      through sheer weight of numbers and ordnance. The result was      thousands of dead and gains measured in yards after weeks of      constant fighting.       Poison gas, first used by the Germans in April 1915 and      later adopted by every nation, added to the daily misery and      danger. By 1916, as the industrial economies of Germany,      France, and Britain became fully geared toward war      production, battles increased in scale and destructiveness.      In the fight of the fortress of Verdun between February and      December, the French and Germans suffered more than 1 million      casualties combined.       On the first day of the Somme Offensive on the 1st of July      1916, the British and French fired more than 2 million      artillery shells into the German lines in support of 19      divisions attacking along only a 20-mile front. Despite this      colossal weight of numbers, the British alone suffered 57,000      casualties on the very first day and did not break the German      defenses. By the time the Somme ended in mid-November, all      sides had suffered more than a combined 1 million casualties,      while the front moved fewer than 10 miles. As a result,      Verdun and the Somme became synonymous with the slaughter and      destruction that defined the Western       As the stalemate in France continued, U.political and      public opinion began to shift from neutrality toward support      for the German atrocities in Belgium, at times      exaggerated by Allied propaganda, shocked many      Additionally, in early 1915, the Germans began an effort to      isolate the British Isles by using submarines, known as      Unterseeboote, or U-boats, to attack British merchant      shipping.                              {time}  1215       The German campaign, which consisted of the unrestricted      sinking of any merchant vessel bound for Britain, was      portrayed by American newspapers as a cowardly and immoral      method of warfare.       On the 1st of May 1915, a German U-boat sank the British      liner RMS Lusitania, killing 1,198 men, women, and children,      including 128 American citizens onboard. After the attack,      The New York Times called on President Wilson to ``demand      that the Germans shall no longer make war like savages drunk      with blood.''       Fearing that such action could pull the United States into      the war, and concerned over British violations of American      shipping rights, President Wilson continued his policy of      neutrality. Seeking to take the moral high road, he      proclaimed: ``There is such a thing as a man being too proud      to fight . . . There is such a thing as a Nation being so      right that it does not need to convince others by force that      it is right.''       However, after the Germans sank the French passenger ferry      SS Sussex in March 1916, Wilson threatened to break off      diplomatic relations with In May, the Germans      pledged to abandon unrestricted submarine warfare, though      they reserved the right to attack legitimate targets such as      armed merchant ships or those vessels carrying war materiel.       As Germany's submarine campaign damaged its relations with      the United States, America's economic relationship with      Britain and France expanded. Faced with a war of attrition,      the Allies relied on agricultural and industrial resources to      support their war efforts.       Despite a British blockade that severely cut American      commerce and its friendly relations to the former central      powers, U.trade with Europe more than doubled from 1913 to      1917. U.companies not only provided civilian goods, but      also war materiel. Bethlehem Steel alone supplied the Allies      with over 20 million artillery shells between 1914 and 1918,      while major weapons manufacturers like Remington and      Winchester sold rifles and guns. Allied governments relied      heavily on the U.banking industry for billions in loans to      finance their war.       Despite the United States' growing economic ties to the      Allies, the American public still preferred that the Nation      remain neutral. The British Government's brutal suppression      of the 1916 Easter Rising in Ireland angered many Americans--     and certainly, Irish Americans--as did its continued      violation of American neutral shipping rights through its      blockade of       As the casualty list grew during 1916, most Americans were      thankful that they had not been drawn into the carnage      engulfing       In November 1916, President Wilson won reelection by a      narrow margin, largely on the slogan, ``He kept us out of      war.'' However, circumstances changed rapidly in early 1917.      Many Americans began to volunteer for the French, great      Britain or Canada, like my Uncle       Germany's increasingly desperate strategic situation led to      a resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare on the 31st of      January 1917. This action broke the earlier pledge of the      Germans to respect passenger shipping and convinced President      Wilson to break diplomatic relations with Germany on the 3rd      of February 1917.       Soon after, the British Government provided Wilson an      intercepted communication from the German foreign secretary,      Arthur Zimmermann, to the German envoy in In the      telegram, Zimmermann proposed that if the United States      joined the war on the Allied side, Germany and Mexico should      enter into an alliance. In return, Mexico, by taking up arms      against the United States, would receive from Germany      supplies, financial assistance. Once a victory was achieved,      Mexico could claim territory in Texas, New Mexico, and            The State Department released the telegram to the      Associated Press on the 28th of February, and the American      public opinion turned sharply, as many became convinced of      German duplicity and aggressive intentions. No longer was the      war seen as simply a horrific folly by the European powers,      but rather as a clear indication of the danger of unchecked      militarism.       With the abdication of the Russian czar in February 1917      and the rise of a provisional representative government,      Americans came to see the war as a struggle that pitted      democracies against aggressive, authoritarian imperialists.       Faced with this clear contrast, President Wilson addressed      this very floor on April 2, 1917, in a joint session of      Congress declaring his desire that: We shall fight for the      things which we have always carried nearest our hearts--for      democracy, for the right of those who submit to authority to      have a voice in their governments, for the rights and      liberties of small nations, for universal dominion of right      by such a concert of free peoples as shall bring peace and      safety to all nations and make the world itself at last free.       On the 6th of April--100 years ago today, where I am      standing--with concrete evidence of German hostility to the      United States, to international peace, and to liberal      democracy, Congress of the United States declared war on       The first act of war committed on Germany was executed that very day, when the United States Army's 1st Battalion, 22nd Infantry marched from Fort Jay, New York, to Hoboken, New Jersey, boarded and seized the German ships in the harbor and interned the German crews. I had the privilege to command the 1st Battalion, 22nd Infantry in Iraq in 2003-2004.  Among the ships seized that day on April 6, 1917, was the SS Vaterland, a luxury liner later renamed the USS This luxury transport would send 10 percent of all doughboys to France and bring a great many of them home as well.  The last American World War I veteran was Frank Buckles, who enlisted from Oakwood, Oklahoma, in August of 1917. He died only 6 years ago, in February 2011, at age 110.  I had the privilege to know a great many World War I veterans. The last time I saw my great-grandfather was when I came home on leave as a young Army captain. As we had a very pleasant visit and it came to a close and I had to go, he told me: ``Don't go yet. I want to give you something.''  He returned from his bedroom with some items in a cigar box that I remember looking at as a kid. He said: ``I want you to have these.''  I said: ``I can't take these, grandpa. Those were your brother's.''  He said: ``You will take them because I know you will keep Frank's memory alive.''  He was right. They have been displayed by me ever since, wherever I have been.  As we reflect today on the declaration of war 100 years ago on this very spot in 1917 that began the United States entry into World War I, let us embark on a national centennial remembrance for all Americans of that day who sacrificed so much for our They are all gone now, but as long as we who knew them have breath and remember them, they will live.

Sadly, they are also under attack.[[Page H2771]]  The President's recent budget outline called for the defunding and dismantling of the So I have gathered here with my friends and colleagues in the hope that we can help the President change his mind and demonstrate to him the immense benefit that the NEA and the NEH bring to our districts, our country, and, in fact, the world.  Being a Rhode Islander, I have always felt a special connection to the arts and humanities. Rhode Island was founded as a colony that welcomed free expression of religion, and that freedom of thought quickly translated into an independent mindedness that drove creative endeavors. It is no wonder, then, that into such an environment was born one of the 20th century's great statesmen and a champion of the arts, our late senior Senator, Senator Claiborne  Senator Pell was a mentor of mine, and I actually had the privilege of interning with him twice at one point. He is rightly lionized for many of his legislative achievements, including the Pell grants that bear his name. But I believe that no issue was closer to his heart than that of preserving and promoting American art and culture.  Anyone who knew the Senator knew that his own passion was reflected and redoubled by his wife, the indomitable Nuala Pell, one of the great supporters of the arts that my State and our country has ever seen. The National Endowments for the Arts and Humanities can trace their beginnings to the passions of the Pells, the vision of President Kennedy, and the determination of President  President Kennedy began his term with a focus on American culture, when he invited Robert Frost to read a poem at his inauguration. He soon followed this up by appointing August Heckscher his Special Consultant on the Heckscher's report entitled, ``The Arts and the National Government,'' led to the creation of the President's Advisory Council on the  Meanwhile, Senator Pell, the chairman of the Senate Special Subcommittee on the Arts and Humanities, was hard at work. He began his first hearing in 1963 with this statement: ``I believe that this cause and its implementation has a worldwide application; for as our cultural life is enhanced and strengthened, so does it project itself into the world beyond our shores. Let us apply renewed energies to the very concept we seek to advance: a true renaissance--the reawakening, the quickening, and above all, the unstinted growth of our cultural vitality.''  So over the next 2 years, working with legislators including Senators Hubert Humphrey and Jacob Javits and Representatives Frank Thompson and William Moorhead, Senator Pell crafted President Kennedy's vision into a reality. With the full support and assistance of President Johnson, the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities Act was signed into law on September 29, 1965.  The first Chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities, incidentally, was another Rhode Islander, Barnaby Keeney, then president of Brown  Mr.Speaker, I begin this hour with a survey of history for a couple of reasons. First, I think that it is vital that both Members and the President understand the care and consideration that went into creating the So years of deliberation by some of our finest legislators went into the determination made in the arts and said:       While primarily a matter for private and local initiative,      the arts and humanities are also appropriate matters of      concern of the Federal  So there is no doubt that private foundation and corporate philanthropy are the bedrock of artistic funding in this country. Nonetheless, there is an important role for government at all levels to play, and the Endowment serves as the catalyst for governmental involvement.  Second, looking back helps remind us of the aspirations that drove the creation of the Endowments in the first place. Last week, we learned of the death of Yevgeny Yevtushenko, a Soviet poet who defied his totalitarian government. When President Kennedy brought poetry to his inauguration, it was in direct contrast to the Soviet Union, where literary dissidents were imprisoned or exiled and not given freedom to create.  What a message to send to the world in the 1960s, that the United States prized artistic expression, celebrated scholarly inquiry, and believed in the strength and progress embodied by multiculturalism. So the playwright in New York was not censored. He was cheered. A historian in North Carolina was greeted not with accusation, but acclaim. The painter in Nevada was not imprisoned; she was empowered.  Placed in context, the message sent by the creation of the Endowments was that America's culture was not just an asset to be protected, but a powerful tool for promoting freedom worldwide.  Just as importantly, the 1965 act recognized that American culture was not static. Rather, its evolution over time was the source of its power. However, I believe the most important reason to begin with the history of the Endowments can be found in the Arts and Humanities Act itself: ``An advanced civilization must not limit its efforts to science and technology alone, but must give full value and support to the other great branches of scholarly and cultural activity in order to achieve a better understanding of the past, a better analysis of the present, and a better view of the future.''  Why do we study the arts and humanities? Why do we promote them in the Halls of Congress? ``To achieve a better understanding of the past, a better analysis of the present, and a better view of the future.''  Mr.Speaker, I co-chair the Congressional Cybersecurity Caucus, a caucus that owes its very name to the work of an artist, William Gibson, who first coined the phrase ``cyberspace'' in 1984. Gibson helped create the lexicon that we use today to describe the internet as we know it and, in so doing, helped to shape its development and growth--a better view of the future, indeed.  For years, I promoted the STEM to STEAM movement, the concept of adding art and design to the STEM disciplines of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.  Incidentally, this movement is another product of my home State, courtesy of the brilliant minds at the Rhode Island School of Design, in particular, as I understand it, then former President John Maeda, who, as I understand, coined the term ``STEM to STEAM.''  Incorporating principles of art and design in STEM helps foster creativity, encourages collaboration, and can engender sudden, inspired breakthroughs, all by helping to better analyze the present.  So in my role in the Armed Services and Homeland Security Committees, I am presented daily with new threats brought on by the advent of new technologies or fast-moving global events. The temptation to act quickly is strong, and sometimes immediate reaction is warranted; but more often than not, it is through examination of the past that I find a path forward.  These United States have weathered many crises over the centuries--some of our own making--but by better understanding of them, I can better analyze the present and better see a future of America peaceful, prosperous, and free.  Mr.Speaker, I know my colleagues have stories to tell of the great works that the NEA and NEH have supported in their districts, and I will share some of those stories as well. But I hope my words on the history of the Endowments have helped shape our understanding of their incredible purpose and ideals of President Kennedy, President Johnson, Senator Pell, and their colleagues.  America is better for the Endowments existing. The world is better for it. To cast them away in a budget outline that zeros them out without even a word of justification is a tragedy.                              {time}  1115  It dismisses the ideals of our forbearers as insignificant.

It has been shown that exposure to the arts stimulates students' learning, their motivation, and their creativity.  Those students involved in the arts score significantly higher in the SATs than other students. Now, more than ever, the arts often seem to be one of the first programs cut from a school or a government budget.  In fact, this President has proposed eliminating both the Endowments entirely--the first time any President has proposed such a measure. This has been supported by Democrats and Republicans because it is meaningful to the entire  The NEA, the National Endowment for the Arts, has already sustained significant budget reductions. The NEA appropriation is 12 percent lower than it was in 2010. It declined to $19.5 million.  And while I understand, when everything is a priority, nothing is a priority, I understand that this priority affects the spirit of the greatest Nation in the world.                              {time}  1130  The importance of arts and humanities is not something we should even forget, even in the face of tough economic times. The arts support 4.7 million full-time United States jobs and, as you have heard, creates billions in economic activity each year.  In New Jersey, the National Endowment for the Arts last year provided over $1 million in direct grant funding to 13 arts organizations, community groups, schools, and artists, as well as enabled the New Jersey State Council on the Arts to award 171 grant and nongrant services totalling over $13 million. So there are consequences and a ripple effect to the few Federal dollars that are provided and targeted.  In my hometown of Paterson, New Jersey, the Council for the Humanities has awarded grant funding to the Hamilton Partnership for Paterson in support of their work for the Great Falls National Historical  Humanities organizations like these enrich the cultural and historical benefits of the Great Falls through programming and community involvement initiatives. That is why it is crucial that we ensure that they receive the funding and the recognition they deserve.  The budget proposal does damage to Americans across the board. One area taking a massive hit, if I may use a parallel, is health care. This budget would cripple the NIH, the National Institutes of Health, slashing funding by $5.8 billion, equal to 19 percent of the current $30.8 billion discretionary budget. The budget takes aim at vital antipoverty programs that directly impact health care because poverty causes poor health. So our physical health is going to take a toll.  But it is our mental health that could be improved through a strong arts foundation, helping to relieve stresses and lift American spirits. Spiritual health of Americans, supported by the NEA and the NEH, is a key piece of our overall well-being.  As an active member of the Congressional Arts Caucus, I have spent years opposing those who wanted to slash funding for the National Endowment for the Arts and  I will continue to work with my colleagues--and I pledge to you today that I will--on these Federal initiatives that possess widespread and bipartisan support.  Democrats and Republicans have always come together on this issue. It lifts our spirit as a culture and a nation. You mentioned Yevtushenko before, a Russian poet who came to New York City in the fifties. I only know a few words in Russian, but I went anyway because he was going to read his poetry in There was no interpreter there.  Yevtushenko had been in the midst of the Russian He had been in the midst of people trying to gain a voice. I just know a few words; nonetheless, I was moved by his spirit, like watching a painting or looking at a photograph or going to a movie. I understand without knowing the words. That is what a poem should be. It should be, regardless of meaning, in any language. Whether it is music, art, poetry, sculpture, cinema, photography, dance, it doesn't matter.  This is the heart of Our children are drawn to it. And we even use art and the humanities now to help those people through very distressing times, which is very interesting and fascinating.

We spend in this country a very modest amount, .004 percent, so four one-thousandths of 1 percent is the budget of the National Endowment for the So it is a very modest budget.  Forty percent of the programming for the National Endowment for the Arts supports activities in high-poverty areas. So the contributions it makes are enormous to our economy. For every dollar that is invested in the arts, it yields $51 in economic activity. So there are tremendous economic benefits to this.  In addition to that, as was referenced by Representative Price from North Carolina, arts, culture, and creativity are essential parts of the job skills for the 21st century. People want to employ people who are entrepreneurial, creative, problem-solving; and arts and music are some of the best vehicles to develop those skills.  So it is something which is important to the future economy of our country, to the kind of civilization that we will be a part of. It adds to the lives of everyone that we will represent.

I have learned throughout my professional arts education and arts management careers that, yes, the arts are nice; but beyond being nice, they are absolutely necessary and essential to enriching our lives.  Artists connect the past to the present. They convey our unique experiences. And they are presented in many forms, sometimes familiar and other times unfamiliar.  A universal language, the arts speak to people everywhere to help them understand diversity and cultures and some of the most complicated issues.  The arts and humanities are critical for adding value to our shared culture. They are not just used to mark celebrations, but to challenge perceptions of society.  Museums function as tools to house and preserve our collective history as a nation and bind us together as one community. Visual artists reflect on our society and they force us to reconcile our past. Writers record history and expose and challenge readers to different ideals presented in our society. Musicians transcend social and cultural boundaries to connect the listener through the sound of their instruments.  Time and time again, we have made a conscious decision to fund the arts and the humanities, signaling that we intrinsically value the arts as being crucial to our collective identity.  The NEA and the NEH have been and continue to be necessary to the success of the arts and humanities in my home State of North As a Representative of Charlotte, one of the largest cities in the South, I understand how important the NEA and the NEH is to Charlotte's unique and thriving art culture.  In 2016, the NEA invested $60,000 in grants in Charlotte for programs such as the Children's Theatre of Charlotte Inc.'s performance of the ``Journey to Oz'' and the McColl Center for Art and Innovation's exhibition and residency featuring Latino and Hispanic artists. NEA grants make these cultural events possible not just in my State, but in States throughout this  The arts not only provide entertainment, but they also encourage us to think critically. Advocates and researchers have shown that the arts have a positive impact on a young person's development. And because of this understanding, the arts and music were included in the Every Student Succeeds Act as part of a well-rounded education.  The NEA is a critical component to ensuring strong arts education in our schools. Through direct grants, the NEA is able to support crucial preschool through 12th grade education projects.  By establishing partnerships with our colleges and universities, the NEA is able to engage with our institutions of higher learning to provide necessary grants to preserve and restore historic works of art.  As a college art professor, I had the privilege of working with the NEA to secure a matching grant, which allowed the college to preserve and restore a historic painting by Aaron Douglas, the father of the Harlem  In order to continue to ensure that our students remain competitive in a global society, we must continue to fund the arts.  In addition to the cultural and educational impact of the arts, they play an important role in helping our veterans transition to civilian life and combat physical and mental illnesses. Through the NEA Military Healing Arts Partnership, the NEA has worked with the Department of Defense to create an art therapy program to treat servicemembers with traumatic brain injuries and associated psychological health issues at the Walter Reed National Military Medical This program places art therapy at the center of a multidisciplinary treatment approach.  Through art therapy, our brave servicemen and -women are able to receive specialized treatment that enable them to heal both their physical and their mental wounds. Participants in the program have found relief and have seen vast improvements in sleep, communication, pain, and their ability to confront emotional challenges. This program has also invested in critical research on the impacts and the benefits of this treatment.  The NEA's budget for fiscal year 2017 was $148 million, just .004 percent of the Federal budget, a small amount.  Through a relatively small investment in the arts, we are able to yield large returns. Not only do the arts serve us culturally in terms of being significant, but the nonprofit arts and the cultural sector is an economic driver, supporting about 4.13 million jobs and contributing to a gross domestic product of 4.2 percent, or about $729 billion.                              {time}  1145  The arts are crucial. They are critical to our culture. They are crucial to our education and to our economy. And in all respects, it is the arts that make us human. So funding for NEA and the NEH must remain in the Federal budget.  I would urge my colleagues to support us in that effort to keep the arts as a viable part of our budget, which means that it will be a viable part of our communities.

I am very pleased to join my colleagues in taking this time to speak about the critical importance of the National Endowment for the Arts, NEA, and the National Endowment for the Humanities,  Any great civil society will grow even stronger by embracing the arts and humanities, and certainly America, when she embraces the arts and the humanities, grows to the greatest potential; so the greatness of America is reflected by that interest and that investment.  At a time when some are arguing that we must cut our way to success, I would remind them that investments in the arts and in humanities are investments in our workforce and in our economy. I fully support funding for these programs.  The National Endowment for the Arts provides a foundation for America's artistic excellence, her creativity, and innovation that benefits individuals, communities, and our industries.  As NEA Chair Jane Chu once said: ``Although many may not realize it, the arts actively intersect with areas such as the economy, human development, and community vitality.''  The NEA, as a strong sponsor of the arts and artists, is an integral source of strength at these intersections, challenging students to turn imaginative ideas into brilliant solutions for generations to come.  Art in our communities, and especially in our schools, is indeed vital. It is one of the most important ways that we celebrate our unique regional heritage and expand our own horizons of creativity and innovation.  In the capital region of New York, the area that I am so proud to represent, we value the arts. So much of our artistic achievement would not be possible without the National Endowment for the  For many years, the Albany Symphony Orchestra has received NEA grants in support of the American Music  The Arts Center of the Capital Region has received NEA grants for exhibitions, workshops, and master classes.  Yaddo has been the recipient of many NEA grants to support residencies for collaborative teams.  Fence magazine uses NEA grants for publication of books of poetry and podcasts.  Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute was just awarded an NEA grant for residencies to create works investigating the intersection of art, media, technology, and, yes, science.  Without the NEA, these programs would not be there to enrich our communities and our lives.  National Endowment for the Humanities awards also support research and innovation, strengthen critical thinking and writing skills, as well as strengthen humanities education in all institutions of learning.  Supporting the growth of the humanities in our communities is just as essential. The National Endowment for the Humanities has contributed in many ways to the capital region, which has a very rich history and heritage worthy of preservation, promotion, and celebration.  Many of our institutes of higher education have benefited from these grants, including RPI, Skidmore, Union College, and SUNY Albany, to name a few.  Some of the projects that have been funded by NEH include the Underground Railroad History Project of the Capital Region, which explores the complex relationship between the Underground Railroad, the end of the Civil War and Reconstruction in our region, as well as the influence of these events on our contemporary society.  Investments in the humanities also drive us to be better citizens. NEH has supported the League of Women Voters of New York State Education Foundation, which is working toward the celebration of women's right to vote and the 100th anniversary of the League of Women Voters in New York State to celebrate the upcoming events commemorating the women's suffrage centennial.  Grant recipients include the Girl Scouts, the Troy Boys and Girls Club, libraries, museums, high schools, and elementary schools. Our history reminds us of the pride that comes with developing community and neighborhood, investments that those who came before us made in growing families, developing households, building neighborhoods in powerful and meaningful ways.  This conversation is also closely linked to two other important fields that are intertwined with the arts and humanities. First, I am a longtime supporter of America's heritage areas, special places that have played important roles in shaping our They tell the stories of people and communities, the pioneer spirit of which laid the foundations of our society.  Heritage areas provide enormous economic benefits, and I greatly appreciate the work that the Erie Canalway and Hudson Valley heritage areas have done for upstate New As the co-chair of the Congressional National Heritage Area Caucus, I continue to be impressed by how the entire National Heritage Areas program operates on a very small budget. These cost-effective programs create jobs and grow our local economies.  In fact, each Federal dollar invested in this program leverages more than $5 in non-Federal funds. That is exactly the kind of smart investing we need to see more of.  By the way, thank you to the 77 Members who joined me in supporting funding for heritage areas.  I am also supporting funding for the Institute of Museum and Library Services because museums are a vital part of our communities and educational infrastructure. These museums collectively employ 400,000 Americans and have an impact of $20 billion in their communities.  During my time in Congress, I have been a steadfast advocate for our Nation's museums, and I have urged my colleagues to robustly fund the Institute of Museum and Library Services, the primary agency that supports our Nation's 33,000 museums. It is highly accountable, and its great competitive, peer-reviewed grants programs serve all  This year, we had 166 Members signing on to that letter. So it is very obvious, NEH, NEA, IMLS, and National Heritage Areas are fundamental investments in our communities. They make life richer, more meaningful; they inspire us; they challenge us. They need to be funded. Let's move forward with the critical funding they require and deserve.

26,FOSTER,1888,proceeding_id,topic_id,820,"Mr.Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman from Rhode Island for yielding and for leading this important conversation.  We come here today to call attention to a misguided turn that this administration proposes to take in our country's cultural history.  I am the only Ph.D physicist in Congress, so I frequently come to the floor to speak out in defense of science and scientific research, but I am here today[[Page H2776]]for another reason, to call attention to the grave threat that President Trump's budget poses to the future of our country's arts and culture.  What is it that makes a country great; and how will our country be viewed a generation from now, a century from now, or in the next millennia?  To answer this question, we can only look to the great nations of the past. Why was Athens great in a way that Sparta never was?  Why is Florence, under the Medici, revered and remembered in a way that its forgotten competitors never are?  It is because, after they defended their homeland, after they conquered their rivals in war, after they triumphed in commerce, those countries invested a significant fraction of their national wealth in things that had nothing to do with material conquest.  The Medici supported the science and the art of Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and the Renaissance masters; and Athens supported the immortal accomplishments of the Greek storytellers, historians, artists, and philosophers, and that is what made them great.  For many decades, our country has supported the arts and humanities through the National Endowments for the Arts and the Now our President has proposed a budget that would cut these Endowments completely in favor of more defense spending and a useless wall on our southern border.  The National Endowments for the Arts and the Humanities provide critical funding for students and organizations throughout the country, including in my district in His budget proposes that we wipe them away completely. These cuts might make the President feel like a hero in the short term, but they will be a disaster for our country's place in human history.  Programs that support understanding of the arts and humanities play a vital role in our society. They give us knowledge and a shared cultural base that we rely on every day, regardless of what career we go into. And they also help children and students of all ages embrace the complexity and the wonder of humanity.  History, literature, and the arts connect us to a common past and allow us to explore our differences and to understand places beyond our own imaginations. Simply put, the arts and humanities teach us how to be compassionate and understanding toward other people. This is what makes America truly great.  The National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities help show us what it means to be human because, regardless of who you are and what you do, knowledge, empathy, and compassion are the national values and the human values that we need to defend, not with bombs and fighter jets, but with sustained support and the cultivation of knowledge and culture.  Now, for most of my career in science, I worked at Fermi National Accelerator The founding director of Fermilab, Robert Wilson, spoke eloquently about this over 40 years ago. Bob was a physicist who worked on the Manhattan Project and who walked away from his security clearance and dedicated his life to pure science, to building giant accelerators, experiments, international collaborations at Fermilab to explore the fundamental properties of matter.  He was also an artist who, after he made all of the magnets and particle accelerators, then filled his laboratory with graceful and imaginative art.  In 1969, he was called to testify in front of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy to answer why it was that we were spending all of this money at Fermilab during the Cold War and what all this had to do with the national defense.  Robert Wilson looked the committee in the eye and said that all of the work at Fermilab, driven by natural human curiosity, has nothing at all to do with the national defense except, perhaps, to make our country more worth defending.  So I would hope that a President so bent on building his wall and increasing our defense budget by over $50 billion, to the detriment of funding for education, science, and the arts, would pause for a moment and heed those words from history so that a century from now, when our children and grandchildren look back on this time in our country's history, they will see that the human values of our country were always what made it more worth defending, in part, because of the greatness that the National Endowments for the Arts and the Humanities have sustained for decades.  So I thank my colleague from Rhode Island for this important discussion.  ",CREC-2017-04-06-pt1-PgH2770-5.txt,CREC-2017-04-06-pt1-PgH2770-5.xml,FUND THE ARTS AND HUMANITIES,2017,4,6

28,LANGEVIN,1668,proceeding_id,topic_id,1339,"Mr.Speaker, like my colleagues, I too have stories of the impact that the National Endowments for the Arts and the Humanities have back home, and some of these stories are small and deeply personal. I would like to thank the wonderful leaders of the Rhode Island Arts and Humanities Council for helping to collect them so that I can share them with everyone here today.                              {time}  1200  The State of Rhode Island is deeply indebted to Randy Rosenbaum and Elizabeth Francis for their work in promoting the arts and humanities. The State councils are an essential component of the Endowments' efforts, and we are incredibly lucky in Rhode Island to have Elizabeth and Randy heading up our initiatives.  One of the stories they shared comes from FirstWorks, an NEA-supported organization that helps connect students experiencing new types of performance with artists premiering new pieces. FirstWorks recently helped bring together a Philadelphia hip-hop group with high school students in downtown The students participated in a workshop with one of the dancers one day and followed it up with a lecture and a matinee performance the next.  FirstWorks had just created a Spanish-language version of their student survey, which they administered after the matinee performance. Students were asked to rate their enjoyment and explain why they gave their answer. Two Spanish-speaking students responded that they loved the performance because it was ``the first time they went to one.''  The FirstWorks team weren't exactly sure what the students meant. Was it the first matinee? Was it the first time seeing the hip-hop group? So they followed up with the teacher, who wrote back: ``These students have never been to a live performance. It just goes to show you how important these opportunities are for our population. They will remember this forever.''  This is the kind of impact the arts can have on our communities.  Another story comes from an artist who has, with the help of State Arts Council funding, been working with underserved communities for 6 years. She helps students learn to apply themselves to art projects in a way that builds self-confidence and helps them learn the power of their imaginations. About an elementary school student named Danny, she wrote: ``When I first started working with him, he did nothing but whine and cry and insist he couldn't do anything. With my encouragement, he took his own ideas and went with them--in a puppet workshop, he made three stuffed animals instead. He sleeps with them every night now. They make him feel safe.''  There are hundreds of these stories in Rhode Island alone, and they would simply not be possible without the support of the  Of course, some projects supported by NEA and NEH are on a much larger scale. It is virtually impossible right now to find a Rhode Islander who, today, doesn't know about WaterFire, Providence's massively successful creative placemaking project. I have experienced this wonderful WaterFire many times myself.  For those of my colleagues who have not had the pleasure of attending a WaterFire--and, Mr.Speaker, I am happy to extend an invitation to all of my colleagues to come and to visit--it is a dynamic sculpture, basically, with dozens of these metal baskets or metal braziers transforming the rivers of downtown Providence.[[Page H2777]]  This groundbreaking artwork has completely transformed Saturday nights in Providence, with tens of thousands of people flocking downtown for each lighting and the performances, music, and camaraderie that accompany it. It is hard to describe it in words, but it has been transformative. WaterFire really has fundamentally altered the way Providence is viewed and the way the people of Providence view themselves. Support from NEA is helping WaterFire further explore creative placemaking, and it is incredibly meaningful.  A final thought to share comes from Professor Touba Ghadessi, a board member for the Rhode Island Council on the Professor Ghadessi was asked to share her thoughts on why NEH matters for all Rhode Islanders, and I truly cannot improve upon her words. This is what she had to say:  ``The Rhode Island Council for the Humanities uncovers beautiful stories about individuals and places and brings them to life--these stories become our history and make us understand that we, too, write the narratives that construct culture. The intentionally diverse programming that RICH supports builds communities that, eventually, will view diversity as normalcy--this normalcy is the one I aspire to construct for the next generation. RICH allows for our best selves to come forward and celebrate together what culture teaches us--from the struggles of social justice, to the legacy of first peoples, to the craft of filmmaking for children. All of these things matter. All of these things make us better human beings. All of these things turn us into ethical and engaged citizens of the world. Without an understanding of the humanities, opinions become facts and truth is debatable. History has offered us a roadmap to behaving with integrity--we can't ignore it or ignorance wins.''  Mr.Speaker, I cannot think of more important words for these times, and I would ask all of my colleagues to reflect on what it will take to view diversity as normalcy and why it seems today that the truth is debatable.  Mr.Speaker, I thank all my colleagues for being here today. I am proud to share my thoughts on why it is so important that we not zero out the National Endowment for the Arts and Humanities and the incredible impact they have on our communities.  I have one more story from my district about the impact of the arts and humanities that I'd like to share.  It, too, relates to the legacy of Senator Pell, but it also points to the broader cuts to arts and humanities in the President's budget outline.  A decade after the passage of the National Foundation for the Arts and Humanities Act, Senator Pell was again at the forefront of cultural preservation and promotion when he sponsored legislation creating the Office of Museum  While the Office was eventually rolled into the Institute of Museum and Library Services, it continues to support great work, which I saw firsthand last year in my district when the Tomaquaq Museum in Exeter was awarded the prestigious National Medal for Museum and Library  Recently, we in Rhode Island have been celebrating the 350th anniversary of our charter and Roger Williams's respect for the Indigenous People he lived among.  But far too often, this story treats Rhode Island's tribes as bit players rather than delving into their rich culture and history.  The Tomaquag Museum's founders recognized this flaw in the narrative in the 1950s, and while I'm disappointed it took the rest of us so long to catch up, I'm incredibly proud of all the recognition it's received of late.  The Tomaquag Museum remains the only Rhode Island institution dedicated solely to the history and culture of the state's indigenous population, and I have experienced its power to start conversations and change attitudes in our communities.  Unfortunately, IMLS, too, is slated for defending under the President's budget outline.  We are very lucky that my home state Senator, Jack Reed, has taken up Senator Pell's mantle in pushing for its reauthorization and full funding.  But it is important that all of my colleagues join together to protect the NEA, the NEH, IMLS, and support for the arts and humanities throughout the federal budget.  We must do so because of the lives touched and forever altered by these organizations.  We must do so in order to achieve a better understanding of the past, a better analysis of the present, and a better view of the future.  We must do so because it is good policy.  I hope that hearing the stories shared today has helped cement that fact in the minds of my colleagues, and I look forward to working with them to continue to promote the arts and humanities.  With that, I again thank all my colleagues who joined me this morning.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-06-pt1-PgH2770-5.txt,CREC-2017-04-06-pt1-PgH2770-5.xml,FUND THE ARTS AND HUMANITIES,2017,4,6

43,HUIZENGA,2028,proceeding_id,topic_id,801,"Mr.Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr.Speaker, we all know that small businesses and entrepreneurs are the heartbeat of the American economy. Access to financial capital is vital for entrepreneurs seeking to start up, operate, or expand their businesses. However, gaining access to capital has remained an enduring challenge for many small businesses.  The financial crisis and the Great Recession made the situation worse, frankly, as capital became increasingly hard to access from institutional banks and various capital market players. While conditions have improved somewhat in recent years, many entrepreneurs continue to struggle with accessing the capital they need to compete and to grow.  In order to succeed, these companies need capital and credit, the lifeblood for growth, expansion, and job creation. Yet the government continues to construct arbitrary walls that cut them off from essential financing, as smaller companies are caught in a sea of regulatory red tape created by Washington bureaucrats.  We know that 60 percent of all net new jobs that have come into this country, that have been created here in the United States, come from these small businesses. They are oftentimes S corporations, LLCs, sole proprietorships. Small companies often have such owners also be operators. They are working alongside their fellow employees.  That 60 percent of those jobs that have been created here in the United States isn't just a one-time blip. That is over the last 20 years, the last two decades, that we have seen that trend.  Congress has made strides in tailoring the regulatory environment for smaller companies, no doubt, most notably when we passed, with strong bipartisan support, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups, or JOBS, Act in 2012. This was a bipartisan bill that was signed into law by President The JOBS Act's benefits are notable as more and more companies use its provisions to raise investment capital in both the public and private markets.  The JOBS Act has raised the cap on investors in a privately held company from 500 to 2,000 investors, but the limit on the number of investors acting as a coordinated group to invest in a company remained at 100, where it has been since 1940, some 77 years ago.  As noted by Kevin Laws of AngelList in his written testimony before our Capital Markets Subcommittee: ``With online fundraising and general solicitation becoming more common because of the JOBS Act, companies are bumping up against the limit more frequently. The current limit . . . now acts as a brake on the amount of money the company wanted to raise, leaving tens of millions of dollars on the table that did not go into startups.''  While H.1219, the Supporting America's Innovators Act, a bipartisan bill introduced by the vice chairman of our Financial Services Committee, Representative Patrick McHenry, and Nydia Velazquez of New York, would amend the cap currently contained in the Investment Company Act to allow 250 investors for a ``qualified venture capital fund,'' therefore enhancing angel investors' ability to provide important funding to small businesses.  This bill is a very modest increase to the current exemption that has been in place for nearly 77 years. Modernizing this cap is long overdue and reflects today's capital markets and the reality of the increasingly important role that angel investors and others play as they commit the funds necessary to help small businesses grow.  The Securities and Exchange Commission, unfortunately, continues to ignore the backlog of good ideas to spur capital formation, which is recommended by entrepreneurs, small businesses, and market participants from their annual SEC Government-Business Forum on Capital This is a forum that is put together annually. They take and solicit ideas. They want to hear from people that are in the marketplace to figure out what ways they could go to improve that. Unfortunately, they have not acted on[[Page H2760]]this, and in the SEC's absence, Congress must act to promote market efficiency and capital formation.  I think we can all agree that we support smart regulation that protects investors and maintains orderly and efficient markets. But outdated, excessive, and unnecessary regulation whose costs outweigh benefits is dumb regulation that overburdens smaller companies. Let's provide some regulatory relief by enacting the bipartisan bill that will ease the burdens on small businesses and job creators and help foster capital formation and get Americans back to work.  Mr.Speaker, I would also like to note, in a hearing that we had on this bill last Congress, it passed our committee 52-2, including the ranking member voting for it. There were no dissenting minority views that were offered, and no amendments were offered at the Rules Committee on this. We have got a lot of consensus. I believe this is the right thing to do to move forward.  Mr.Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  ",CREC-2017-04-06-pt1-PgH2759-2.txt,CREC-2017-04-06-pt1-PgH2759-2.xml,0915,2017,4,6

In light of that and in that history, in that spirit, we have reached across the aisle, and Representative Velazquez and Ranking Member Waters worked with me to craft a very good bill here today.  This bill is targeted at small businesses across the rest of the country. We know that 78 percent of venture capital goes to just three If you are in Austin, Boston, or the Silicon Valley, you have capital flowing to you; you have funds for your idea. The rest of the country, whether you are in an urban area or rural area, is starved for capital.  In light of that problem, we are trying to work for a solution for those small businesses, those innovators with good ideas that maybe don't have the best access to capital. We raised the cap on angel investing, thereby allowing more people to participate at a lower threshold dollar amount while still including important investor protection.  Today is a great victory for small-business folks that need access, that need capital to take their idea to market. Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure.

Mr.Speaker, I rise in support of H.1219, the Supporting America's Innovators Act of 2017, which I am proud to cosponsor with Mr. Throughout my career here in Congress, I have always supported and encouraged legislation that creates jobs and fosters innovation for America's entrepreneurs and small businesses. The bill we are considering today will further that goal.  Mr.Speaker, I always say access to capital is access to opportunity. That is exactly what this legislation does.  The Investment Company Act of 1940 currently limits the number of accredited investors in a venture fund to no more than 100 individuals, but most funds try not to reach that limit in order to adjust for unforeseen circumstances. This artificially low limit restricts the number of individuals that can invest in small businesses and startups. That means less opportunity for entrepreneurs.  Our bill will address this problem by allowing up to 250 accredited investors to participate in venture funds with up to $10 million in capital.                              {time}  0930  It is important to stress that these are accredited investors. They have at least $200,000 in minimum income or $1 million in net assets. These are sophisticated investors comfortable with the risks involved in the startup sector.  Many of these investors pool their money together either in local or national groups. More recently, many have gotten involved in online crowdfunding platforms, which were created through the JOBS Act, to funnel more capital to small businesses and startups.[[Page H2761]]  Our bill will create greater access for women-owned and women-led businesses. The types of funds empowered to attract more investors under this bill are often a good capital source for women-owned firms.  I am proud that our bipartisan legislation has garnered a wide range of attention and support from the industry. The Angel Capital Association and the Internet Association have endorsed the bill. These are groups dedicated to expanding capital opportunities for small businesses.  This bill has also moved through the legislative process with strong bipartisan support every step of the way. Last month, we passed this bill out of the Financial Services Committee with a broad bipartisan vote of 54-2. The same day, the Senate Banking Committee was busy passing its bipartisan companion version, 444, sponsored by Senators Heitkamp and It is also important to recognize that, last year, this Chamber passed a nearly identical version of our bill by a vote of 388-9.

This bill will increase the number of accredited investors who can invest in an angel or venture fund before requiring the fund to register as an investment company. This will encourage capital formation in one of the major types of funds that seed startups and helps bring new ideas to market.  Innovation and invention are integral to economic growth, but new ideas are only the first step in the type of businesses that can grow the economic pie. It is crucial that these companies have access to capital to grow and to bring the product to market. Competition from startups, bolstered by access to funding, creates jobs and forces incumbent firms to stay aggressive in their own research and development.  H.1219 is exactly the type of bipartisan legislation that Congress should be considering to facilitate capital formation.  This bill will make it easier to form a fund made up of sophisticated investors who can assess and bear the risks that come with investing in startups. These funds are capped at $10 million in paid-in and callable capital. This means the funds will largely be engaged in angel investing that helps early-stage investors build a better mousetrap. These funds can often be cheaper for the company and can be structured as equity debt or a combination of both.  A fund like this can bring expertise and connections that increase the likelihood of success for the inventor. It can also spread the risk and rewards for investors because it is important to note that not every invention will turn into the next big thing.  We need a startup ecosystem that encourages the testing of new ideas and products with a wide range of risks and rewards. This bill is a targeted measure to help create that ecosystem by enhancing the ability of early-stage companies to get funding.  Mr.Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill today.

Businesses that overcome the challenges are faced with numerous regulatory roadblocks that further hinder their growth. Many of those have come at the hands of regulatory frame works like Dodd- But this bipartisan measure that we are talking about today has the opportunity to help the challenges with capital acquisition that government has created and continues to create. Currently, the Investment Company Act of 1940 requires any qualified venture fund over 100 to register with the Securities and Exchange  The real burden of these regulations hits small companies in middle America like Ohio's Eighth District where, unlike major cities, particularly on the coast, we do not have as many options for raising capital.  Not every company seeks to become the next billion-dollar blockbuster, but some of them do. All these companies offer great jobs and give many people the dignity of work, but they can also provide great returns. So we are crowding out investment opportunities, and we are crowding out job opportunities.  This is why I am pleased to support H.1219, the Supporting America's Innovators Act of 2017, which simply increases the cap to allow up to 250 investors to be exempt from registration for qualified venture capital funds, allowing America's small businesses the flexibility to operate and grow their companies, hire employees, and innovate.

I want to encourage all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this bill, H.1219.  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.  Pursuant to House Resolution 242, the previous question is ordered on the bill.  The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.  The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the passage of the bill.

69,GOHMERT,1801,proceeding_id,topic_id,3564,"Mr.Speaker, it is always a privilege to be in this last bastion of civility. Sometimes it hasn't been all that civil, but it has been a place where the rules were supposed to be enforced.  I know there are all kinds of wild allegations being thrown around. People seem to enjoy throwing them at this White House, but I think we all owe a debt of gratitude to the President this week. This has been a very big week, as an article by Kaitlan Collins from The Daily Caller points out: our President hosting three foreign leaders this week in what could be a big moment for foreign policy. Well, this was dated April 2.  One guest that he invited that I am so grateful that President Trump invited was the Egyptian President, Abdel Fattah el-It has been my privilege with some of our other colleagues, and I have had other occasions alone to visit with him in I am just so grateful he was invited because Egypt is doing everything it can. The leaders of Egypt right now are doing all they can to try to prevent an international caliphate that is dominated and enforced by radical  In years past, when I brought up that there are some radical Islamists who are wanting to create a new Ottoman Empire--and I think it is an indictment of some of our schools, both secondary and college level, that more people are not familiar with world history. So I referred some reporters to a map. Go look at a map, look at where the Ottoman Empire was, look at what countries were included in that empire, and look at what the Islamic State is trying to do, what al-Qaida had tried to do, and what radical Islam, with really Muslim Brotherhood playing a powerful role in trying to create part of that caliphate, you look at what they have done, advances made, and it is very clear that those who wanted a new Ottoman Empire that many thought was over 100 years or so ago, we would never see the rise of radical Islam controlling so much of north Africa and  Then, of course, during World War II, radical Islamists raised their heads. They had something in common with Many don't realize that radical Islamist leaders were allied with Hitler because they shared what? A common hatred for Jewish people. They both wanted Jewish people annihilated. They wanted a genocide. They wanted them wiped off the In the early days, the United States, to our discredit, did not do enough to help the[[Page H2780]]Jewish people who were the target of that genocide, both by radical Islamists but largely led by Hitler himself.  So when that great June uprising in Egypt that was completely peaceful by the Egyptian people--the only real violence was instigated by the Muslim Brotherhood, and the Muslim Brotherhood continues to this very day to plot and to strategize to try to take back over the country of With over 90 million people or so in Egypt with such a critical location, the Nile River running through Egypt, being right there at the Suez Canal, being right there at the gate of the Middle East, being at the gate to north Africa from the east, it is a critical linchpin for any radical Islamist who wants to start with a caliphate.  Of course, the true radicals, though they have some disagreements over what real radical Islam is, they all agree that to get back this worldwide caliphate, we actually must get Egypt back under radical Islamic control.  Having met President el-Sisi, visited on a number of occasions, even before he was President, this is a man who wants to do the will of the people. He is also a man who has 20/20 vision when it comes to looking at the Muslim  It was rather tragic when President Obama and two Republican Senators started putting pressure on the 30-plus million Egyptians who made clear that despite Morsi, the Muslim brother leader who allegedly was elected despite the claims of fraud in the election that were not followed up on because of the threats that were made by the Muslim brothers that if you contest this election, we will burn Egypt down.  But the 30 million after the election, once they saw Morsi was acting extra-constitutionally, he was taking powers that didn't belong to him, really kind of following the model of Chavez in Venezuela where, yeah, he got elected, and then he used that position to start knocking off and eliminating competition, pulling powers under himself. Morsi was doing that. And, of course, there is video of him taking marching orders from a radical Islamic leader. So some think he was more of a puppet at the whims of radical Islamic leaders.  But that was such an incredible day for the world, when 30 million Egyptians, moderate Muslims, Christians, Jews, secularists, they went to the street. Some people are not aware, yes, there are Jews in There is a millennia of history there. But they went to the street, and as I have mentioned before, Mr.Speaker, the Pope there in Cairo has told me on more than one occasion just how deeply emotionally moving it was to have secularists, Muslims, and Jews come up to him and say there in the streets as they marched together peacefully: We are so sorry for the way you have been treated by the Muslim We are so sorry for the persecution that our leaders have inflicted upon you and Christians here in  What a great day for the world when they demanded, peacefully but demanded, the removal of the President who would be king, Muslim brother  And now we still have some in this country, former President Obama and others, who had such wrongheaded policies that put the world so much at risk by supporting Muslim Brotherhood, they complain that this President, our President Trump, doesn't know what he is doing. It appears to me he knows exactly what he is doing when it comes to radical Islam, to those who want an international caliphate, to those who are moderate Muslims, like President el-Sisi, who has actually had the courage to stand up, as I have not seen any national or international leader do, and tell a roomful of imams that it is critical that we get control of Islam back from the radicals who have hijacked it.  It did a disservice when the last administration kept saying the Islamic State, the radicals in Egypt, radicals in Libya, al-Qaida, that they are not Well, yes, they are. And that is why President el-Sisi had to make clear: We need to get our religion back. Baghdadi, who is head of the Islamic State, has made very clear that, yes, the Islamic State is Islamic, and if moderate leaders don't step up and rein in radical Islam, then this world is headed for disaster.  Though we had some disagreements here recently on other matters, I still think that the media attention that is given claiming Trump is this crazy guy, that Donald Trump puts the world at risk, they are so reflective of the comments that were heard about a guy named Ronald Reagan when he was  As I mentioned last fall in a private meeting with now President Trump, I said, you know, my study of American history seems to indicate that those Presidents who were considered by the media to be our smartest Presidents, when it came to foreign matters, foreign policy, they were some of the least effective.                              {time}  1245  In some cases, actually, terrible at foreign policy and foreign diplomacy, it seems that some of our most successful Presidents, when it comes to foreign policy, have been depicted as being just a little bit crazy.  And I mention to now President Trump, if he will remember back to the days of ``Saturday Night Live'' when it was funny, they did skits about President They enjoyed portraying President Reagan walking around as if he was in some daze or stupor, with his finger out asking where the red button is--``Where is the red button?''--like he was so anxious to start a nuclear war.  But when you analyze the history of our Presidents and their effectiveness at foreign policy, I think you actually end up seeing that, when the world is a little bit concerned about a United States President being just a little bit crazy--``That guy is crazy enough, he may start a nuclear war''--it is a fantastic help to diplomacy, so that when a President like Reagan or Trump says, ``This is it. Don't do this because I will draw a red line,'' they can't be sure that he won't launch a nuclear war.  So I hope that he won't take anything off the table. I think he has handled some of these issues very well. As he has said: I am not taking anything off of the table. I am not going to warn our enemies of exactly what we are going to do and when.  That is wise counsel in handling foreign diplomacy.  I am looking forward to the days ahead, because this week, in meeting with President el-Sisi, it sent a message to the world that President Obama refused to send, and that is we think we can work with President el- He has his hands full. Egypt has a tough road ahead because they are trying to come back from what had become a quite socialized government in A lot of people are on some form of welfare.  It is always difficult, as one of the Caesars found, when you try to move people off of bread and circuses and get them to working so that they will find out they have value, provide self-worth. Every individual has value in God's eyes, and the Founders knew that. So let's get them working. Most everybody can do something. And leaders like President el-Sisi are attempting to do that.  It was also an embarrassment for the United States, and those that are observing world affairs, to have noted that an incredible world event happened since President el-Sisi has been the head of the government in They opened a second lane to the Suez There were top leaders from most all of the more powerful nations in the world. They came to honor Egypt and their incredible accomplishment of opening a second lane. It didn't go all the way the distance, but it allows for so much more traffic through the Suez  I remember one conversation prior to that with President el-Sisi, when President Obama had promised Muslim brother leader Morsi: We will send you tanks. We will send you jets. We will send you money. We will send you Apache helicopters.  President Obama was more than happy to send powerful weaponry that the Muslim brothers could use to go after Christians to weaponize the Sinai, as Morsi did.  A lot of Americans had the wool pulled over their eyes, including some at AIPAC, who didn't realize, as they sent people around to support President Morsi, that: Oh, gee, we think he is a lot better than people are giving him credit for.  I knew who he was. I know what he was. But some of the top folks at AIPAC did not realize you don't want[[Page H2781]]to be supporting a Muslim brother President or leader anywhere.  And, in fact, we should do right here in the United States what Egypt did, and that is list the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization. Now, it is true in the United Some of their leaders have said, oh, no, we don't want to get to violence, because the indications are they believe that they are making so much progress, and they really did. Under the leadership of President Obama, the Muslim Brotherhood made vast strides in power in the United States without violence, so they didn't want to jeopardize that.  But as some of the documents that had been seized over the last 30 years make clear: Yeah, we will use peaceful means as long as we can; but, of course, at some point, when we are no longer successful in gaining the upper hand in America, we will have to support violence to do the final takeover.  But some people here get it. They understand the threat that the Muslim Brotherhood is.  It is great that President Trump invited Egyptian President el-Sisi to be here to meet with him. And, Mr.Speaker, I look forward to the day when we have enough time to have President el-Sisi stand right here where Prime Minister Netanyahu has stood at least, I think, three times and where other great international leaders have stood and have spoken to a joint session. I look forward to the day when we have President el-Sisi stand here. The man is a true hero for the world, for everyone except the Muslim  President Trump also welcomed King Abdullah of Jordan, King Abdullah, leader of a majority Muslim country. And, of course, those who have studied the Bible know that so many of the Biblical references actually are right there in  Some wondered why President Obama didn't get much encouragement from those around him to go ahead and do a status of forces agreement with We know that Iran was making so many of the IEDs, putting people and weapons inside the country of Iraq, while American soldiers were fighting, losing their lives, being maimed, losing arms and legs--our great heroes--carrying out the will of the U. It seemed that President George Bush pretty well had a status of forces agreement teed up. He probably could have finalized it. For all the criticism that some heap onto President Bush, he is actually a very gracious man. Look at the time he entertained people at the White House and was so gracious. People like Ted Kennedy that would walk right outside and trash him after he had been so gracious to him.  But he actually left a hanging curve ball for President Obama to hit after he came in as And from what I understood from people in the Bush administration, they thought this would help his Presidency come in and very quickly sign the status of forces agreement that should be easy to get done.  But one of the things--well, there were two main things, it seems, from what I can figure out, that stood in the way of the status of forces agreement. One was President Obama really didn't want to leave troops in Iraq, not even a small force, to help solidify what we had taken away from the radicals. And he didn't use good judgment, which has now cost the lives of tens of thousands--hundreds of thousands of people in the Middle East because of his shortsightedness.  Another reason that there is no status of forces agreement was an element I didn't realize until I was talking to my friend Joel Rosenberg, a great author, a New York Times Best Seller author. Joel has done so much fantastic research into Israel, Egypt, and the Middle His novels reflect so much history that is accurate.  He was pointing out to me--and I had not seen it until he pointed it out and I started doing some research on it. But some of the crazies who think that the 12th imam, who was thrown in a well as a child around 10 years of age, is going to some day come back and take over and be the great Mahdi, the 12th imam, that unites the world caliphate and puts everyone under radical Islamic control of the Mahdi, the 12th imam, most of the 12th-ers believe, those who believe the 12th imam is coming back, some have said they have already seen him on short appearances.  There are prophecies that the 12th imam will first come back and take charge in a small town. I believe it is pronounced It is kind of like the Bible prophesied that the Messiah would be born in  Well, those who believe the 12th imam is going to come back--and, actually as I understand, they do believe in They believe he is going to fight at the right hand of the 12th imam, so they don't have anything close to the beliefs that Christians do and the orthodox Jews do. But the only way he can come back and begin the start of this reign, if he comes back to Kufa, there cannot be any infidel soldiers, infidels in the land, occupying the land.  So if the United States had an occupying force in Iraq, it is going to impede the ability of the 12th imam to come back and start the beginning of the worldwide caliphate that will fall in place thereafter. And, of course, he is supposed to emerge from chaos.  There were those in Iran at the top who thought--not rank-and-file people, but some at the top thought, look, he is supposed to come out of chaos. He will appear here in this small town and start the beginning of the accumulation of the world caliphate.  So, in Iran, if you were a crazy top leader in Iran that believed that is where the 12th imam is coming back, you could not allow the United States--that they consider infidels, the Great Satans--you could not allow the United States to have a status of forces agreement so that we had what they consider infidel soldiers. So it wasn't anticipation that Iran would fight so hard to keep America from agreeing to keep soldiers in Iraq, and part of that is because President Obama did not allow people who had studied radical  Now, he had Muslim brothers around him. That is what Muslim Brotherhood publication indicated in December of 2012, I believe is when that article came out, bragging about the six people that were in top positions, people like Imam Magid; and Elibiary, who was on the Homeland Security Advisory Council, the top advisory council for Secretary of Homeland Security Janet And I pointed out conflicts there that were disregarded and problems that his allegiance was not to us; it was for a more radical Islam, for the Muslim brotherhood at least.                              {time}  1300  Finally, when he tweeted out that the caliphate--the world caliphate is inevitable and Americans just need to get used to it, they finally decided to let him rotate off advisory council. But the Muslim brothers were bragging about the people they had in top positions that were advising President  There are some holdovers in positions who were not top Muslim brothers, but they are in positions that I hope this President will be able to root out. And I think it helps a great deal that he talks to President el-Sisi, he talks to President Abdullah, because some of these radical Islamists are also a great threat to King Abdullah in Jordan, and we need him keeping peace on the eastern side of  And then you also had the Chinese President come, and we have got to deal with China because they are a power and they own a lot of our debt.  But I appreciate what was reported this week. Ali Waked at Breitbart reported from Tel Aviv:  `` . . . Abdel Fattah Sisi's visit to the United States . . . will be an opportunity to undermine the Muslim Brotherhood's standing in Washington, a former Egyptian Ambassador to the United States said.  ``Abdel Raouf al-Ridi told Egyptian paper Alshorouk that `Egyptian-American relations are entering a new phase, and the degree of their success relies on Egyptian efforts.' ''  He went on to say: ` ``Presidents Trump and Sisi can break the ice created during the Obama administration,' he said. `Without doing injustice to Obama, he adopted the ideology of the Muslim Brotherhood.' ''  He is talking about President President Obama would never admit that. Who knows whether he was taken in or really understood what he was embracing.[[Page H2782]]  But one other great thing that I want to express appreciation for is the President's steps on trying to stop illegal immigration into this country.  Mr.Speaker, as I have talked about a number of times, having spent so much time all night on the border, the drug cartels control traffic coming into America, and they have people that they are smuggling in through their coyotes who actually get paid to bring them in. That money goes to the drug cartels and they coordinate. The drug cartels, according to the Border Patrol, coordinate sending in these groups of illegal aliens in the United They knew, when they sent a big group in on one or more rafts, that all of our border patrolmen would have to flock to that area and start processing them, go through their checklist of questions, and that is when they could send massive amounts of drugs in.  So what President Trump is doing is a great favor to the United When he stops illegal immigration, he is not just stopping illegal immigration, he is stopping the ability to bring in drugs, making it more difficult. Oh, they are still coming, but it is a start. And I am grateful to the President for doing that.  Mr.Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-06-pt1-PgH2779.txt,CREC-2017-04-06-pt1-PgH2779.xml,REINING IN THE RADICAL ISLAMISTS,2017,4,6
70,FOXX,1791,proceeding_id,topic_id,816,"Mr.Speaker, last weekend I had the pleasure of visiting Bridges Academy, a charter school in State Road, North The school was celebrating the decision by the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction unanimously to renew its charter for an additional 10 years.  Bridges Academy opened in 1997 as one of the first charter schools in North Established by a local community group, it is overseen by a grassroots, local board of directors. It serves a rural population from surrounding systems in Alleghany, Surry, Wilkes, and Yadkin counties, and Elkin city.[[Page H2779]]  The mission of Bridges Academy is to provide all students with the opportunity to develop an academic foundation that empowers students to reach their full potential. It has focused on students that are struggling in the traditional school setting.  The school is doing great work, especially in regard to serving students with disabilities who, on average, make up 45 percent of the student body. There is a teacher assistant in each class providing accommodations and modifications to all students. End-of-grade proficiency among the subgroup of students with disabilities is in the top 3 percent of the  Bridges Academy is fairly unique for a charter school in that it provides transportation for students in three counties. When nearly 90 percent of the student population is considered economically disadvantaged, the school offers free breakfast and lunch for all students through the Community Eligibility Provision, and a food backpack program is offered to the neediest students each  All lead teachers at Bridges Academy are highly qualified, while 50 percent of the regular education teachers also hold licensure in special education. New leadership in both governing board members and administration several years ago has led to growth in accountability, student population, and campus construction.  We have always known what makes a great school: it is a great principal who attracts great teachers and parental involvement. That is what you see at Bridges Don't take my word for it, though. Listen to this testimonial from a parent who wrote:  ``As the new school year approaches, I wanted to take a moment to write. I can't thank you enough for being there for my daughter.  ``You and the Bridges staff have made such a difference in her life. Before we moved here and found this wonderful school, my daughter was struggling. She was isolated and bullied by her classmates and so depressed that she didn't fit in with the other children because of her emotional and learning disabilities.  ``At Bridges, she was welcomed with open arms and she knows that everyone on staff is working for her best interests. Finding her teacher, who is from our home State, was truly a blessing. She understood that my daughter needed to learn in a different way, and you helped her adjust to our new community.  ``Always remember that you and the school that has done so much for my daughter will continue to have my support.''  The power of an excellent education is truly life-changing. I know because it changed mine. As a child, I attended public school. It was a very poor school, but it provided some very positive experiences. The lessons learned and encouragement provided there have helped me go further in life and achieve more than I ever dreamed.  There are countless stories just like mine. Every day, students take classes, hear lectures, or receive advice that will have long and lasting impacts on their lives. That is why it is so important we continue working to improve K-12 education and ensure all students are able to benefit from those opportunities.  Every student in every school deserves an excellent education, but, unfortunately, we are falling far short of that goal as a nation. Thankfully, innovative charter schools like Bridges Academy are providing thousands of families with new hope and opportunity.  School choice provides real hope to moms and dads, and school choice has provided the students at Bridges Academy with a high-quality education and a greater chance to succeed in life.                              {time}  1230  School choice is a powerful tool to help children succeed, and I am encouraged by the momentum that is building. The challenge we face is extending the promise of school choice to more students and families.  As chairwoman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, that is a challenge I take seriously and one I am committed to tackling head-on.  The bipartisan Every Student Succeeds Act includes a number of reforms to expand school choice; and across the country, efforts are underway to empower families with more educational options, including charter schools, home schooling, scholarship programs, and education savings accounts.  We must ensure Federal policies support--rather than discourage--innovative school choice and explore additional opportunities to expand the promise of school choice.  I look forward to the work ahead and exploring additional opportunities to provide parents more choices for their children's education.

71,FOXX,1791,proceeding_id,topic_id,151,"Mr.Speaker, on Monday night, fans across my home State and the entire country were ecstatic as we celebrated the University of North Carolina's sixth NCAA men's basketball championship. It was a thrilling evening.  But in the Fifth District, one company was getting to work. Five minutes after the 71-65 victory against Gonzaga, the presses at NVIZION, Inc., in King, North Carolina, started moving and printing thousands of championship T-shirts commemorating the national title. The company runs two presses on a typical day but ran four presses to fill the order of five different championship designs. The dedicated staff stayed until the last T-shirt was printed, folded, packaged, and picked up.  Congratulations to the UNC players on their hard-fought victory, and thank you to the folks at NVIZION for producing the victory T-shirts that I am sure have been quickly snapped up by the university's dedicated fans.  How about them Heels?                          ____________________",CREC-2017-04-06-pt1-PgH2778.txt,CREC-2017-04-06-pt1-PgH2778.xml,BRIDGES ACADEMY,2017,4,6
