A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act and the Social \\nSecurity Act to provide improved and expanded access to comprehensive \\nprimary health care and related services for medically underserved and \\nvulnerable populations through the provision of financial support for \\nthe development of community-based health networks and plans, to permit \\nfederally-assisted health centers to expand their capacity and develop \\nand operate new sites to serve underserved and vulnerable populations, \\nto provide certain financial and other protections for such networks, \\nplans, and health centers, and to facilitate the involvement of, and \\npayment to, entities serving underserved and vulnerable populations in \\nthe training and education of primary care health professionals, and \\nfor other purposes; read the first time.\\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, today I join with five colleagues from \\nboth sides of the aisle to introduce the Access to Community Health \\nCare Act of 1994.\\n  This legislation will build a comprehensive, community-controlled, \\nprimary health care service infrastructure throughout this country--an \\ninfrastructure that will expand on the Community and Migrant Health \\nCenter approach that has a 30-year track record of success in diverse \\ncommunities nationwide. Every major reform bill, from Representative \\nMichel's legislation to Senator Wellstone's, recognizes this success by \\nproviding major increases for the C/MCH program, so I am more than \\nwilling to share credit for this idea. However, we go one step further \\nin this bill to preserve and expand the proven health center concept in \\nthe developing health market. Also, I must caution that this does not \\npretend to be a comprehensive health reform bill, because it does not \\naddress the question of universal insurance coverage. However, any true \\nhealth reform bill should incorporate this legislation to meet the \\nneeds of our urban, rural, and poor areas.\\n  As my colleagues know, Community and Migrant Health Centers exist in \\nevery State. Each center is a private, nonprofit corporation run by a \\ncommunity board, at least half of whom are center patients. The center \\nagrees to accept patients without regard to their ability to pay, and \\nto provide or arrange for comprehensive primary care. Care is provided \\non a sliding fee scale, and centers meet an array of quality and \\nperformance standards. In exchange, shortfalls in revenue from \\ninsurance and out-of-pocket charges--between 30 percent and 40 \\npercent--are made up by a Federal grant.\\n  This proven formula of payment-blind admissions, Federal support, and \\ncommunity empowerment has been a 25-year success story. Health centers \\nhave cut infant mortality by up to 40 percent, Medicaid costs for their \\npatients by 33 percent, lengths of stay in the hospital by one-half to \\ntwo-thirds, while reducing hospital admissions up to 67 percent. And in \\nprobably the most stunning statistic, total costs per patient, \\nincluding Federal grant funds, insurance reimbursements, and out-of-\\npocket patient costs, run less than $300 per year. In short, Community \\nand Migrant Health Centers have been a cost-efficient model for the \\ndelivery of community-controlled health care in exactly the areas that \\nneed them most.\\n  Mr. President, our bill builds on this successful model in three \\nways. First, our bill guarantees expanded funding adequate to establish \\naccessible primary health care in all underserved areas. This is \\ncritical because a health insurance card alone will not provide \\nadequate service for people in underserved areas; without expanded \\naccess, the more than 40 million Americans in underserved areas will be \\nshortchanged by health reform. They will seek emergency care at the \\nhospital, and our national effort at cost control will fail.\\n\\n  Also, our bill adds flexibility to the current law to establish \\ncommunity owned and operated networks and plans consisting of essential \\ncommunity providers. These networks would agree to live by health \\ncenter rules: providing care without regard to ability to pay, charging \\non a sliding-fee scale, agreeing to provide a comprehensive list of \\nservices, and accepting community control. In short, in areas that will \\nnot support several competing health plans, we provide the resources \\nand structure for a community-controlled primary care system built on a \\nmodel that has proven quality and cost-effectiveness for decades.\\n  The second thrust is to ensure adequate numbers of highly trained \\npeople to staff these facilities. As in the President's legislation and \\nthat of Senator Chafee, we would increase funding for the National \\nHealth Service Corps to provide scholarships and loan repayment for \\nprimary health professionals who agree to serve in shortage areas. \\nAlso, we would encourage health training in the geographic areas that \\nmost need health professionals by providing direct payment to cover the \\ncost of their training. Current Medicare graduate medical education law \\nonly assures funds to institutions that operate accredited training \\nprograms, effectively locking in the available funding to existing \\nmedical schools and teaching hospitals. This bill would allow direct \\npayment for the costs incurred at a center or network which is part of \\na hospital or medical school training program.\\n  The third thrust is to preserve the safety net of dedicated health \\nproviders in underserved areas so that they are not run out of business \\nby market trends or by health care reform. The Government has invested \\nin medical care for the good of all Americans--through research, \\ntraining, tax breaks, and direct insurance. In areas that the market \\ntraditionally has not served and that will continue to be underserved \\nwithout special efforts, we need to promote stable access and quality, \\nand not lose our investment or jeopardize the health of citizens in \\nthose areas. To ensure continuing access, this legislation strengthens \\ncurrent Medicaid safeguards by ensuring inclusion of health centers \\nunder section 1115 or 1915 waivers. These provisions are modeled after \\nmethods used in Maryland, Wisconsin, and Minnesota to make sure that \\nthese providers are not put at undue risk. It also ensures continuation \\nof a reasonable payment rate to these providers.\\n  Mr. President, this legislation meets the front-line health care \\nneeds of today's America. In my hometown of Charleston, SC, there is \\ncurrently no pediatrician accepting new children on Medicaid. \\nSimilarly, a pediatrician in Spartanburg--population 43,000--writes to \\nme that this is ``the only pediatric private practice that accepts \\nMedicaid in the city of Spartanburg.'' Ninety-five percent of his \\npractice is Medicaid. One wonders about the children who do not live \\nnear his office. The children can have insurance, but service is a \\nstruggle. Increasingly, I hear the same thing from senior citizens who \\nmove or whose doctors retire--no one wants their insurance. This \\nlegislation ensures a medical home for these people that is stable, \\nhighquality, responsive, and costeffective.\\n  Mr. President, we do not need to reinvent the wheel in primary care. \\nWe have a proven, effective model. Our challenge is to provide that \\nproven model where it is most needed. There is bipartisan agreement on \\nthis point, and serious cost savings to be made. I urge our colleagues \\nto join us, and parallel with our debate on the complexities of \\ninsurance reform, let us come to final agreement now that basic \\nservices will be available throughout this country.\\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join in \\ncosponsoring the Access to Community Health Care Act of 1994. This \\nlegislation is essential for rural and urban medically underserved \\ncommunities and should be integrated into the broader context of \\nnational health reform.\\n  The legislation builds on the highly successful Community Health \\nCenter and Federally Qualified Health Center Programs. Today, these \\ncenters provide primary and preventive health services to over 7 \\nmillion of America's poor, uninsured, and medically underserved. Their \\nprograms have produced a stellar track record, demonstrating that the \\nspecial needs of high-risk populations can be served with quality and \\ncost-effective care.\\n  America's network of community, migrant, and homeless health centers \\nare responsibile for bringing doctors, services, and facilities to \\npeople in great need. For over 30 years, they have served in some of \\nthe most neglected, devastated, and economically distressed areas of \\nthe country. Their mission is to break the barriers to health care, to \\nmake health care accessible, and to keep people healthier and more \\nproductive, and out of hospitals and costly emergency rooms.\\n  Community Health Centers, like the 45th Street Clinic and Country \\nDoctor in Seattle and Yakima Neighborhood and Columbia Valley in \\nCentral Washington, have succeeded where others have failed because \\nthey are part of the life of the communities they serve. They are \\npartnerships of people, governments, and communities working together \\nto meet health care needs. Their innovative outreach programs focusing \\non prevention, health education, and patient-centered needs, have \\nmerited widespread recognition and strong bipartisan support in the \\nCongress.\\n  This bill not only provides for expansion of services, but assures a \\nmeaningful role for health centers as essential providers in the new \\nhealth care environment. It also provides critical support for health \\ncenter involvement in the training of primary health care \\nprofessionals.\\n  This legislation is a realistic, commonsense approach. It builds on a \\nprogram that has worked well in our neediest communities; that has \\ndemonstrated cost effectiveness; and that has yielded a substantial \\nreturn to the American taxpayer.\\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I support the access to community health \\ncare bill, which will preserve the Community, Migrant and Homeless \\nHealth Centers [CHC's] and allow them to compete in the changing health \\ncare marketplace. I commend my colleague from South Carolina, Senator \\nHollings, for this bill. It has broad support among those who are \\ninterested in rural health issues and problems.\\n  I believe that this legislation will amke health reform work for \\nunderserved communities by significantly expanding America's health \\ncenters, developing strong, community-based networks, and involving \\nessential providers in primary care training.\\n  It is important to continue building an infrastructure to facilitate \\ncoordinated approaches to solving rural health care problems. I believe \\nthis legislation is a step in the right direction.\\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this \\nlegislation.\\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of \\nthe Access to Community Health Care Act of 1994.\\n  This is a critical part of health reform if we are going to make sure \\nthat many citizens are not left out and if we are really going to lower \\ncosts and improve health.\\n  Mr. President, it is no secret that many areas lack adequate basic \\nhealth services. And if we do not provide access to the basics--to \\nroutine and preventive care--we will pay more for hospital care.\\n  For three decades the Community and Migrant Health Center Programs \\nhave demonstrated an effective model for solving the diverse health \\ncare problems of underserved communities. They have brought community-\\ncontrolled, cost-effective preventive and primary care to the areas \\nthat need them most at a current per-person annual cost of well under \\n$300. They have lowered infant mortality up to 40 percent. They have \\nlowered Medicaid costs for their patients by 33 percent. They have \\nreduced hospital admissions and lengths of stay. Clearly, this approach \\nis a bargain and an effective solution we should expand.\\n  This legislation would amend the health centers programs to allow \\nfunding for networks of community providers. This will promote more \\nefficient and comprehensive services in underserved areas. Also, these \\nnetworks would operate according to proven health center principals--\\ncomprehensive primary care services, community and patient control, \\nenrollment without regard to ability to pay, and payment on a sliding \\nfee scale.\\n  Also, this legislation would promote primary health professional \\ntraining in rural and inner-city areas. Currently, Medicare GME funds \\nflow only to hospitals and medical schools for training. This \\nlegislation would also reimburse health centers and networks for the \\ncosts they incur for training. This provision should expand \\nopportunities for health professions students and improve recruitment \\nin underserved areas.\\n  Mr. President, quality, trained personnel and quality, accessible \\nfacilities are the heart of health access. Insurance alone will not \\nmeet the health care gaps that face many of our citizens, but health \\ncenters have proven to fill these gaps. I urge my colleagues to support \\nan expansion of this successful approach to primary health care \\ndelivery by supporting this legislation as part of health reform.\\n  The Access to Community Health Care Act of 1994 recognizes that \\ncommunity-based health care reform initiatives are the appropriate \\nfoundation for enhancing our health care delivery system in the United \\nStates. While I do have reservations over its total cost and the \\nprovisions relating to school-based clinics, overall I think it is a \\nbalanced measure which indicates our commitment to improve health \\nservices at the community level.\\n  Migrant and Community Health Care Centers are delivering critical \\nhealth care services in Utah, in the most cost effective, \\ncompassionate, and professional quality imaginable. I am proud of the \\nexcellent job CMHC's are doing in Utah, and I am hopeful the Congress \\nwill provide them with the tools they need to do an even better job.\\n  I want to take this opportunity to recognize the outstanding efforts \\nof Bette Vierra, executive director of the Association for Utah \\nCommunity Health, and all those who work with her to help citizens in \\nthe underserved areas of Utah receive the vital health care services \\nthey need. Their tireless advocacy for community health is an \\ninspiration to us all.\\n  Finally, I also want to commend Senator Hollings for his leadership \\nin drafting this legislation, and for his foresight in recognizing that \\nexpansion of the Community and Migrant Health Centers Program must be \\nan essential part of our health care reform effort.\\n                                 ______\\n\\n      By Mr. GORTON:\\n  S. 2110. A bill to establish a Federal matching grant program for \\nState and local law enforcement agencies to assist in upgrading \\nfirearms, providing training, and purchasing ammunition; to the \\nCommittee on the Judiciary.\\n\\n\\n               the law enforcement officer protection act\\n\\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this Senator will soon join law \\nenforcement officials in Washington State and across the country in a \\ncandlelight vigil recognizing those officers who have fallen in the \\nline of duty. As we debate the challenges our society faces from crime \\nand violence, let us never forget those on the front line who protect \\nus and our families. Let us remember those brave men and women who have \\nmade the ultimate sacrifice while trying to keep the peace that we so \\noften take for granted.\\n  Since the onset of law enforcement in Washington State, 222 peace \\nofficers have been killed in the line of duty. For the Nation as a \\nwhole, the Department of Justice has estimated that one officer dies in \\nthe line of duty every 57 hours. This cannot be tolerated. Whatever we \\nachieve in our deliberations on criminal justice in this body, we must \\nprovide law enforcement officers the protection and resources the need \\nto do the job to which they are sworn.\\n  Recently a Seattle police officer nearly lost his life in a shootout \\nwith an armed bankrobber simply because he was outgunned. Officer Gene \\nMcClanahan carried a standard-issue six-shooter revolver which he \\nmanaged to fire eight times, twice after reloading. At the same time, \\nthe suspect who carried a semiautomatic firearm was able to shoot at \\nOfficer McClanahan 16 times, hitting him twice. Thankfully, the \\nofficer's life was spared. Others who have found themselves outgunned \\nand underequipped have not been so lucky.\\n  After hearing of this near-tragedy I was stunned to hear that police \\nofficers in the city of Seattle were not provided the firepower that \\nthey meet on the streets. Officers who wished to carry semiautomatic \\nnine-millimeter sidearms had to purchase the weapon themselves at a \\ncost of more than $300. Only recently had they even been given \\npermission to carry this equipment on a voluntary basis and reimbursed \\nfor ammunition used in practice shooting. These officers who would \\nsacrifice their lives were at an unbelievable disadvantage because the \\ncity would not finance a weapons upgrade. It is inconceivable to me why \\nthose who are willing to sacrifice their lives to keep our streets safe \\nmust use their own money to adequately protect themselves and the \\npublic. Those who protect and serve must not have to plead for training \\nammunition and adequate firepower.\\n  After receiving input from the Seattle Police Department, I drafted \\nlegislation which I will introduce today. This bill provides a modest \\nlevel of Federal assistance to those law enforcement agencies in \\ncommunities that have not financed a weapons upgrade and where cops are \\nat an unacceptable risk of being outgunned. The legislation is entitled \\nthe Law Enforcement Officer Protection Act and establishes a matching \\ngrant for the purchase of equipment, ammunition, and training for an \\nupgrade.\\n  News of this legislation already has had a positive result. Several \\nweeks ago, under pressure from an anxious public, the city agreed to \\nfinance a weapons upgrade for the Seattle Police Department by the end \\nof this year.\\n  Although Seattle police officers will eventually have the firepower \\nthey need and deserve to do their jobs, law enforcement officials in \\nother communities still lack support from their elected officials to \\nfinance a weapons upgrade. This modest assistance is also limited in \\nthe time in which Federal funds would be available.\\n  Mr. President, this fiscally conservative Senator knows full well \\nthat this legislation should never be necessary. I am compelled, \\nhowever, to urge acceptance of this measure if it encourages even one \\ntown to upgrade the standard issue firearms for its police officers.\\n  While we seek ways to get guns out of the hands of criminals and end \\ngun violence, we can't give our men and women of law enforcement \\nsecond-rate protection. Far too many brave men and women have died in \\nthe face of superior firepower. It is in their memory that I dedicate \\nthis legislation and ask for its immediate adoption.\\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support from \\nthe Seattle Police Officers Guild be included in the Record.\\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \\nRecord, as follows:\\n\\n                               Seattle Police Officers' Guild,\\n\\n                                      Seattle, WA, April 20, 1994.\\n     Senator Slade Gorton,\\n     U.S. Senator, State of Washington.\\n       Dear Senator Gorton: On behalf of the entire Board of \\n     Directors, members of the Seattle Police Officers' Guild and \\n     myself, we want to express our deepest appreciation and \\n     thanks for your proposed legislation providing monies for \\n     upgrading Police Officers' firearms.\\n       We unanimously support the passage of this bill.\\n           Sincerely,\\n                                              Kenneth R. Jakobsen,\\n                President, Seattle Police Officers' Guild.\\n                                 ______\\n\\n      By Mr. BREAUX (for himself and Mr. Packwood):\\n  S. 2111. A bill to foster further development of the Nation's \\ntelecommunications infrastructure and protection of the public \\ninterest, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \\nScience, and Transportation.\\n\\n\\n        the telecommunications services enhancement act of 1994\\n\\n  Mr. BREAUX. Madam President, I think it is clear to all of us in \\nCongress that the world is changing. It changes every day. The way we \\ncommunicate in this world is also changing. We communicate differently \\nwith the people across the street or across this country or, indeed, \\nacross the world.\\n  What, however, is not changing is Congress. Congress has not over the \\npast many years changed the way we have looked at communications law in \\nthis country. Communications technology has changed dramatically since \\nthe last time Congress addressed the question of communications policy. \\nAs a matter of fact, the last major communications act in Congress was \\nadopted back in 1934--60 years ago. Over the past 60 years, it is clear \\nthat communication technology has made dramatic and serious advances in \\nthe way we communicate with our neighbors around the world.\\n  Unfortunately, because Congress has not kept up with the changes in \\ntechnology, we find that the policy in communications has been made \\nover the past several years not by those of us in Congress in response \\nto our constituents but, rather, those policy decisions on what \\nconstitutes good communications policy have been made by a district \\njudge in the District of Columbia and not based on a communications \\nstatute passed by the Congress but, rather, based on communications \\npolicy that has really been driven by antitrust legislation.\\n  Madam President, that is not the way Congress should legislate in \\nthis area. I am today introducing, along with Senator Packwood of \\nOregon, an amendment in the form of a bill to the currently pending \\nlegislation by our distinguished chairman of the full Senate Commerce \\nCommittee, Senator Hollings, which is known as S. 1822.\\n  I wish to say right here that Senator Hollings is to be commended in \\nthe strongest way possible for his recognizing that it is, indeed, time \\nfor Congress to act in this very important area. Senator Hollings has \\nhad a long series of hearings in developing his legislation, S. 1822, \\nwhich is now before the Senate Commerce Committee. I think his approach \\nto this is the proper approach and hopefully the amendment which \\nSenator Packwood and I are offering today in the form of a bill will \\nbecome part of that bill S. 1822 and, indeed, provide the real \\nincentives which I think are so important if we are going to have a \\nmodern communications policy for the United States of America.\\n  Simply put, the legislation by Senator Packwood and myself will open \\nup competition, both in the long distance market as well as the local \\nservice market, in a fashion that is easy to understand and easy to \\nfollow and is not complicated by what I fear under the current S. 1822 \\nwould be up to 10 years or more of complicated litigation in the \\ncourts, again allowing the courts to make the communications policy as \\nopposed to Congress.\\n  My legislation will remove barriers to injury in what are likely some \\nof the most hotly contested areas of communication. One year after the \\ndate of enactment, most State or local statutes or regulations would \\nprohibit the inability of any company to provide interstate or \\nintrastate telecommunication services.\\n  Madam President, studies that have been done by independent \\norganizations, which have looked at what I am suggesting is a way to \\ndevelop competition, have come up with figures that I think very \\nstrongly support what I am attempting to accomplish.\\n  Studies have indicated that our legislation would create 3.6 million \\nnew jobs over the next 10 years, 977,000 of which would be in the \\nmanufacturing sector, manufacturing communications equipment. Our \\nlegislation would add $247 billion to the Nation's total real gross \\ndomestic product by the year 2003, a total gain of 3.6 percent over the \\n10-year interval. It would lower the annual inflation rate by nearly a \\nfull percentage point on average over the coming decade, pushing long-\\nterm interest rates more than a full point lower.\\n\\n  In addition, the studies indicated that there would be an increase in \\ntotal investment of $72 billion as lower interest rates would help \\nboost productive capital formation. It would improve the Federal budget \\ndeficit by an additional $150 billion by the year 2003 and also would \\nsave consumers an average of $63 billion a year by lowering both \\ntelecommunication rates and cable TV rates and freeing a comparable \\namount of disposable income for other purchases.\\n  The study estimates, for instance, that of these 3.6 million new jobs \\ncreated by removing these barriers to entry into communication \\nbusinesses, 54,000 of those jobs would be situated in my own State of \\nLouisiana, and about 14,000 of those new 54,000 jobs would be in the \\nmanufacturing area.\\n  One of the concerns that I have attempted to address in this \\nlegislation, Madam President, is the test that the current bill before \\nthe Commerce Committee would require before a local service company \\nwould be able to enter into long-distance service. I think most of the \\ncompanies that have been testifying before our committee would agree \\nthat if the so-called original OHC test were to be applied they would \\nbe able to accept that as a measure that they would have to meet before \\nthey could provide long distance service. The problem with the bill \\nthat is pending before the Commerce Committee is that it goes beyond \\nthe traditional OHC test by providing additional requirements which \\nwould require a local operating company to show there is actual and \\ndemonstrable competition in each relevant area before they would be \\nable to move into the long-distance service area. This, indeed, is the \\ncrux of the problem, Madam President, because the terms of what would \\nbe actual and demonstrable competition are undefined. There is no \\nhistory of communications decisions by courts which really tell us \\nclearly what is in fact actual and demonstrable competition.\\n  I am very concerned that the new standards encompassed in the \\nexisting S. 1822 would further complicate an already overly complicated \\nsituation and result in decades of litigation while local companies \\nwould argue that, yes, actual and demonstrable competition has been \\nshown. Long-distance companies, on the other hand, would come in and by \\ntheir studies show that no, it has not. And then we are off to the \\ncourthouse to litigate once again and have courts make communications \\npolicy as opposed to having communications policy made by Congress, \\nwhich I think is the best place for it to be made.\\n  So our test is very simple. It simply says that after 1 year \\ncompanies would be allowed to compete in other areas. The real problem \\nthat I think all of us are coming to realize in our committee and I \\nthink in other parts of Congress is that these giants that are in the \\ncommunications business have pretty much said we want in yours but stay \\nout of ours. They want in the other company's business but they do not \\nwant the other company to be able to come into their traditional line \\nof business services.\\n  That I think is something which is just not acceptable. We have to \\nhave ground rules which everybody can understand. The legislation by \\nSenator Packwood and myself would clearly spell out a definite period \\nof time after which companies would be allowed to compete. We do not \\nremove any of the protections that would be provided by the Federal \\nCommunications Commission and Department of Justice. In fact, we do not \\ntake any authority away from the Federal Communications Commission or \\nthe Department of Justice.\\n\\n  Our legislation utilizes and relies on them to implement this \\ncongressional policy and to enforce congressional laws that would be \\nadopted. The FCC will continue its authority to impose safeguards \\nincluding separate subsidiary obligations as appropriate to foster \\ncompetition, to define and require equal access in interconnection for \\ninterLATA services, information services, and local carriers, and to \\ntake such other steps as are necessary to promote a competitive market.\\n  I think that the FCC has demonstrated ample skill in the past in \\nthese areas, in some cases requiring even more than the old, modified, \\nfinal judgment requires.\\n  So they would not be restricted in their ability to protect \\nconsumers' interests by our legislation at all.\\n  I point to one feature of the Hollings legislation which I think is \\nvery important. Many of the long-distance companies have said that we \\ncannot get into local service because local companies would not allow \\nus in. The Hollings bill is very clear in this area by requiring that \\ntelecommunications carriers shall be deemed common carriers under this \\nact and that the FCC would prescribe regulations to require these \\ntelecommunications carriers, upon bona fide requests, to provide to any \\ntelecommunications equipment manufacturer or any entity seeking to \\nprovide telecommunications services or information services \\ninterconnection, ability to interconnect to a local carrier's switches \\nand the interconnecting of their services. It requires \\nnondiscriminatory access. So they would be completely protected as a \\nway of getting into the local service area.\\n  I think that our effort is to provide a better bill, a better way of \\naccomplishing goals that we all share.\\n  I commend it favorably to our colleagues for inclusion as ultimately \\nan amendment to the Hollings bill.\\n Mr. PACKWOOD. Madam President, I join Senator Breaux in \\nintroducing the Telecommunications Services Enhancement Act of 1994. \\nThis bill is a simple bill. It lifts the barriers to competitive entry \\ninto the local telephone market within 1 year of enactment. It lifts \\nthe long-distance restriction on the Bell operating companies at the \\nsame time. It repeals the cable-telephone company crossownership ban, \\nallowing telephone companies to offer cable in their telephone service \\nareas upon date of enactment. It requires the FCC to ensure that \\nproviders of competitive services are subject to equivalent regulation. \\nAnd it provides the Federal Communications Commission with the \\nauthority to conform its regulations to the realities of a competitive \\nmarket.\\n  Madam President, back in 1978, the Commerce Committee began work to \\nderegulate a number of industries. Airline deregulation came first, in \\n1978. That was followed by truck and railroad deregulation in 1980, bus \\nand partial broadcast deregulation in 1982, maritime and cable in 1984, \\nand freight forwarders in 1986.\\n  By and large, all of these deregulation bills have worked well. They \\nwere all opposed by those inside the industry. They were opposed by the \\nregulators. The pressure to act came from outside.\\n  When we deregulated the airlines, people feared some airlines would \\ngo bankrupt. Alfred Kahn, the father of airline deregulation, said at \\nthe time ``that's what we expect will happen.'' The market is not going \\nto support weak carriers.\\n  People feared that soon there would be only three airlines--United, \\nDelta, and American. In fact, soon there will be 30 airlines as the \\nbigs spin-off to meet the competition of the smalls.\\n  Oregon has infinitely better service now than we had under regulation \\nand we're at the end of the airline chain. We have 1,200 Delta \\nemployees who weren't in Oregon before deregulation.\\n  We deregulated trucks in 1980. The American Trucking Association and \\nthe Teamsters opposed the effort. But, ask any shipper today if the \\nservice is better than when they were regulated. Removing Federal \\neconomic controls on trucking has resulted in an estimated $30 to $50 \\nbillion in savings.\\n  We also deregulated railroads in 1980. It has been an overwhelming \\nsuccess.\\n  We deregulated buses in 1982. We have seen new carriers enter this \\nmarket and the industry is healthier today because of deregulation.\\n  We partially deregulated radio and television in 1982. And \\ncivilization continues.\\n  In 1984, we passed the Shipping Act and deregulated the maritime \\nindustry as much as we could considering international shipping \\nconventions we must comply with.\\n\\n  We deregulated cable in 1984. We got what we asked for from the cable \\nindustry in terms of more programs, better reception, more channels. We \\nshould not have reregulated the industry.\\n  In 1986, we deregulated freight forwarders, and this has worked out \\nwell.\\n  By and large our experience with deregulation is not that when it \\noccurs the deregulated industry is dominated by a few giants. It is \\nrather spurred and challenged by smart pygmies who frequently run \\ncircles around the giants. Sometimes they find a niche market and then \\nexpand gradually until they too become, if not a giant, why certainly a \\nmajor player which may one day be a giant.\\n  The electronics industry generally has not been regulated. We lead \\nthe world in this area, although with some frequency we have to battle \\nunfair competition from Japan and similar countries.\\n  If we were to totally deregulate the communications industry in this \\ncountry, what would happen. I think we should pick a date a year or two \\nor even three ahead of time and tell everybody the barriers are coming \\ndown on that date and say, ``Gentlemen, start your engines.'' I don't \\nfear that US West would drive AT&T;, Sprint, and MCI out of business. \\nThey would all become more challenged and innovative.\\n  When the modified final judgment was entered and AT&T; was split from \\nthe Bell operating companies, it was argued that AT&T; would dominate \\nthe long-distance market. They are still the biggest carrier, but \\ndomination is the wrong word. Not only is AT&T; having to suffer the \\nslings and arrows of the MCI's and the Sprints, but scores of smaller \\ncompanies that are doing well--companies that did not exist a decade \\nago under regulation.\\n  I have concluded the same thing will happen in the communications \\nindustry generally if we deregulate it. That is why I support the bill \\nbeing introduced by Senator Breaux. It says ``Gentlemen, start your \\nengines.'' There will be no scarcity of competitors. Competition will \\nthrive. The country will be better off for it.\\n                                 ______\\n\\n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Lott, Mr. Inouye, and Mrs. \\n        Boxer):\\n  S. 2112. A bill to amend the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act \\nof 1990 to postpone until 1997 the base closure process otherwise \\nscheduled to commence in 1995; to the Committee on Armed Services.\\n\\n\\n defense base closure and realignment act of 1990 amendment act of 1994\\n\\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today, on behalf of myself, \\nSenators Lott, Inouye, Boxer, and hopefully others, I am introducing a \\nbill to delay the 1995 base closure until 1997. This is similar to an \\namendment we offered to last year's Defense Authorization Act that \\nfailed, but we are introducing this legislation once again because of \\nthe tremendous impact on our States and implications to U.S. national \\nsecurity.\\n  In just the last 5 years almost 250 military bases have been slated \\nfor closure in the United States and the Base Closure Commission has \\nexamined an additional 400-plus bases. Though our Nation needs to \\ndownsize our military in the aftermath of the cold war, I believe that \\nbase closures are proceeding too rapidly. We need to slow down and \\ncatch our breath, and we must be sure that we are not cutting bases \\ntoday which we may need tomorrow. We must also ensure that we are \\nprepared to meet our current financial obligations to those communities \\ncurrently suffering from base closures, before we take on any new \\nobligations.\\n  In addition, these actions have generated tremendous economic \\nturmoil, regional recession, and dislocation for hundreds of thousands \\nof people who depend on military bases for their economic livelihood--\\nall at a time when the Nation is just pulling out of an economic \\nrecession.\\n  The first major base closure round occurred in 1988. Since then, \\nthere has been a round in 1991 and again in 1993. All told, the Nation \\nhas lost over 300,000 direct and indirect jobs as a result of base \\nclosures, the majority in my home State of California.\\n  And, like clockwork, another base closure round is already in the \\nworks. The 1995 base closure round was established way back in 1990, \\nwhen Congress adopted the Base Closure and Realignment Act. Whether \\nadditional bases need to be closed or not, this next base closure round \\nmust occur under current law and it must occur in 1995. In fact, the \\nArmy, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps already have sent out \\nquestionnaires to all of their bases around the country.\\n  Though the cold war is over and some reductions in defense spending \\nare appropriate, I believe that base closures are moving too quickly. \\nWe need to slow down and examine whether further base closures are \\nappropriate. And if so, how many bases should be closed? Can we close \\nmore overseas bases? What should be the timetable for closing bases? \\nAre base closures cost effective? Do we have the financial resources to \\nclose so many bases in such a short period of time? And, what is the \\nprice to the Federal Government, to the working men and women of \\nAmerica, and to the Nation's economy overall?\\n  The Congress and administration should answer these questions before \\nproceeding with another base closure round. Communities across the \\ncountry are still feeling the affects of the 1988, 1991, and 1993 base \\nclosure rounds as those bases continue to close their gates.\\n  By delaying the next round for 2 years, the Federal government will \\nbe able to examine the affects of previous base closures. We will be \\nable to review our force structure and assess the need for additional \\nbase closures. And, we will give the economy time to fully recovery \\nbefore throwing hundreds of thousands of working men and women out of \\nwork.\\n  Though the Soviet Union is no more, the world is still an unsafe \\nplace. There are currently more than 30 conflicts raging throughout the \\nworld, from Yugoslavia to Somalia, and from Republics in the former \\nSoviet Union to the Middle East. Additionally, outlaw nations with \\ndangerous dictatorship secretly strive to produce nuclear weapons. And, \\nso far, Russia has taken only the most tentative first steps on the \\nfragile journey to democracy.\\n  In downsizing our military, the United States can reduce troop \\nstrength and the stockpile of certain weapons, but still quickly build-\\nup again in time of national emergency. But, it is much more difficult \\nto rebuild infrastructure. Once a military base has been closed, it is \\ngone. Is our Nation closing bases today that will be needed tomorrow?\\n  I am also not convinced that base closures actually save money. I \\nunderstand the need to shrink the deficit and reduce government \\nspending. But are base closures truly cost effective?\\n  The 1988 base closure round will have cost an estimated $2 billion to \\nimplement. The total savings from those base closures will be less than \\n$2.5 billion. Therefore, the total net savings from the entire 1988 \\nbase closure round is only $500 million by fiscal year 1995. Only $500 \\nmillion will have been recouped from the 1988 base closure round after \\n6 years, and at a cost of over tens of thousands of jobs and billions \\nof dollars in economic activity nationally.\\n  In reality, these savings from the 1988 base closures may not be \\nrecovered for many more years to come. The Pentagon's estimates for \\nenvironmental cleanup nationwide in the first base closure rounds is \\nnearly $800 million. If this expense is considered, it will actually \\ncost hundreds-of-millions of dollars to cleanup and shut down the bases \\nslated for closure in just 1988 alone.\\n  Though environmental cleanup costs are not considered when \\ncalculating base closure costs, these monumental costs are a \\nreality nevertheless. They must be paid for so that the communities \\nsuffering from base closure can begin the process of reuse and economic \\nredevelopment. Otherwise, the bases remain shut and useless.\\n\\n  As a rule, cleanup costs are grossly underestimated. For example, the \\ncleanup costs for Mather Air Force Base have been revised upward by 360 \\npercent in just 3 years. The Sacramento Army Depot's costs have grown \\nby 350 percent. Castle Air Force Base's costs have grown by over 300 \\npercent. And the story is similar for George and Norton Air Force \\nBases.\\n  If we abide by what history taught us, environmental cleanup costs \\nwill skyrocket.\\n  And, if other cost factors to the Federal Government are considered, \\nsuch as unemployment compensation and defense conversion assistance, \\nbase closures become less and less cost effective.\\n  This Nation must first live up to its commitment to help the \\ncommunities suffering from the first three rounds of base closures. It \\nseems increasingly apparent that the BRAC accounts may be seriously \\nshort of funds. For example, in view of the cost increases that I just \\nlisted, the $4 billion planned for environmental restoration on the \\nbases being closed from the first three rounds may be woefully \\ninadequate. What then?\\n  Does the cleanup process just stop and the bases sit desolate and \\nempty? That would devastate communities--communities that patriotically \\nhelped lead the way during the cold war--and would counter the \\nadministration's five-point base reuse proposal passed by Congress last \\nyear. These bases must be cleaned up in such a way that reuse and \\neconomic redevelopment can take place. This is the Federal Government's \\nresponsibility, no matter what that cost may be. I suggest we ensure \\nthat we can live up to our current responsibilities before we consider \\ntaking on new ones from a new round of base closures.\\n  And to those counting on the savings from base closures to fund force \\nmodernization and readiness, I must warn you that we may have to look \\nelsewhere. The savings will come eventually, but probably not for \\ndecades. Counting on using these savings for other purposes could prove \\nto be a serious mistake. We should not allow this estimated base \\nclosure savings dictate whether we decide to pursue an additional round \\nof closures in 1995.\\n  A headlong rush toward closing more bases is dangerous and \\nunwarranted--dangerous in an increasingly unstable world where the \\nUnited States must stand ever more vigilant; unwarranted in an economy \\nstill trying to pull itself from recession. Let's give the \\nadministration and Congress time to examine the need for additional \\nbase closures. Let's assess the impact of the 1988, 1991, and 1993 base \\nclosure rounds. Let's determine what the true costs are. Let's examine, \\nin terms of today's global unrest, the impact of further closures on \\nthe state of our national defense.

POSTPONEMENT OF COMMENCEMENT OF 1995 ROUND OF BASE \\n                   CLOSURE PROCESS.\\n\\n       The Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 (part \\n     A of title XXIX of Public Law 101-510; 10 U.S.C. 2687 note) \\n     is amended--\\n       (1) in section 2902--\\n       (A) by striking out clause (iii) of subsection (c)(1)(B) \\n     and inserting in lieu thereof the following:\\n       ``(iii) by no later than January 3, 1997, in the case of \\n     members of the Commission whose terms will expire at the end \\n     of the first session of the 105th Congress.'';\\n       (B) by striking out ``1995'' in subsection (c)(1)(C) and \\n     inserting in lieu thereof ```1997'';\\n       (C) by striking out ``1995'' in subsection (e)(1) and \\n     inserting in lieu thereof ``1997''; and\\n       (D) by striking out ``December 31, 1995'' in subsection (l) \\n     and inserting in lieu thereof ``December 31, 1997'';\\n       (2) in section 2903--\\n       (A) by striking out ``1996'' in subsection (a)(1) and \\n     inserting in lieu thereof ``1998''; and\\n       (B) by striking out ``March 1, 1995,'' in subsection (c)(1) \\n     and inserting in lieu thereof ``March 1, 1997,''; and\\n       (3) in section 2909(a), by striking out ``December 31, \\n     1995,'' and inserting in lieu thereof ``December 31, \\n     1997,''.\\n Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, last August, Senator Feinstein and I \\noffered an amendment to the fiscal year 1994 national defense \\nauthorization bill which proposed delaying the 1995 round of base \\nclosures to 1997. Today, we are jointly introducing the same \\nlegislation in order to delay the next round of closures until 1997. \\nLast year I was convinced that delaying the 1995 round of base closures \\nwas a good idea. Today, I am even more convinced that we need to delay \\nthe next and last round of closures by 2 years.\\n  What we must understand is that this Nation's defense not only won \\nthe cold war, but has paid a substantial price for that victory. Since \\n1985, defense spending has been reduced 42 percent. Since 1990, \\nspending for America's defense has been cut 35 percent. This year \\nalone, active duty military personnel will be reduced by 85,000 people. \\nAnother 45,800 Guard and Reserve personnel positions will be \\neliminated. These personnel savings will result in $3.1 billion in \\nsavings to the Department of Defense.\\n  That sounds like a lot of money, but look at what we are doing. The \\nfiscal year 1995 budget request also includes $5.7 billion for \\nenvironmental cleanup and compliance, and that number continues to grow \\nin the future. It is also important to understand that this $5.7 \\nbillion does not include all the environmental money required to pay \\nour base closure bill. In fact, the fiscal year 1995 budget request \\nincludes a $2.8 billion bill for base closure.\\n  The Senate needs to understand that the base closure process is \\nbroken; it does not work. We were told closing bases will save us \\nmoney, scarce money badly needed to pay for training and readiness of \\nour fighting forces. But that is not what is happening. In fact, last \\nyear, the Army was forced to reduce their tank training--Operational \\nTempo--by 180 tank miles because projected revenues from base closures \\nnever occurred. That is a nice way of saying, ``The money we thought we \\nwould receive for getting rid of bases never happened.'' No clearer \\nexample can be found which shows the impact base closures are having on \\nour military readiness and training.\\n  Since 1988, 249 domestic bases have closed in the United States. In \\naddition, 147 bases have had major realignments. Some of these 147 \\nbases have increased employment, but most have reduced employment. All \\nthe while, we were told that money would be saved, that if we did not \\nclose nonessential bases, in 5 years, we could not afford to buy \\nairplanes, ships, or even tanks. Based on the results of tank training \\nfor 1994, however, the opposite is true. The base closure process \\nreduced available money to support thank training.\\n  I ask my colleagues to look at the numbers. Where are the savings? \\nHow does this make sense?\\n\\n\\n                        the base closure process\\n\\n  In 1990 Congress passed the Base Closure and Realignment Act which \\nestablished a formal process to make it easier for the Secretary, the \\nPresident, and the Congress to close bases. The secret was to create an \\nindependent Commission, nominated by the President and confirmed by the \\nSenate, to review recommendations from the Secretary and issue their \\njudgments on the Secretary's list to the President. The President then \\ncould either approve the list and send it to the Congress, or send it \\nback to the Commission. The act was replete with schedules, deadlines \\nand requirements.\\n  As a process, the Base Closure Commission has worked very well. After \\ntwo rounds, together the Department of Defense, the President and the \\nCongress, have sentenced 249 bases for closure. But the process is not \\nwithout problems.\\n  In my own State of Mississippi, over $500,000 has been spent by the \\nState and communities to defend three bases for the past 2 years. \\nMississippi has not been alone in contributing to the incomes of \\nWashington consultants. This past year, the people of Charleston and \\nthe State of South Carolina spent over $1.5 million to defend their \\nbases before the Commission this year. Estimates are that California \\nspent over $4 million to defend their bases, yet they lost over 50,000 \\njobs from closures in 1993.\\n  Not only has Mississippi spent exorbitant amounts to defend our bases \\nfrom the Base Closure Commission's knife, we have faced double and \\ntriple jeopardy. In a court of law, the Constitution protects presumed \\ninnocents from the threat of double jeopardy. But the presumption of \\ninnocence and the threat of double jeopardy are unknown and unheeded \\nprotection for communities facing axe-like attacks of the Base Closure \\nCommission. Mississippi has learned a hard lesson: once you get added \\nto a list--even when you win--you stay on that list.\\n  These are communities which have supported our country in good times \\nand bad. These communities have both suffered and benefited from the \\nvagaries of defense spending. Never in the history of this country have \\nthese communities been under the constant threat of the budget knife \\nthe way they are under the base closure process. States like \\nCalifornia, Florida, New York, Indiana, and South Carolina are only the \\nfirst to fall victim to the defense budget contraction. The next State \\ncould be Georgia, Alabama, Arizona, Mississippi, or even your State.\\n  The time has come to stop and catch our breath. We need to delay the \\n1995 base closure round and reassess where we are. Are we so confident \\nthat we will not need the very defense basing structure we are now \\ncutting with abandon? Can we clearly predict what will happen in \\nBosnia, Haiti, North Korea, or the People's Republic of China? I do not \\nbelieve we can, and if we cannot, then prudence requires that we stop \\nand wait to see where we are going.\\n  This bill does not terminate the base closure process. The bill only \\ndoes two things: First, it acknowledges that we have cut a lot already \\nand that we need to wait 2 years to see what we really need to keep.\\n  Second, this bill suggests that we need to have a better \\nunderstanding of this new post-cold war world before we close \\nadditional bases in the United States. In no way does this legislation \\nterminate the base closure process. It only says, ``Let's wait for 2 \\nyears before we proceed further.''\\n  Now is the time to reassess where we are going in our defense \\nspending. Now is the time for us to stop and consider what capabilities \\nwe will need in the future. Now is the time to stop closing bases and \\nstart counting the costs. So far, we have spent a lot of money. Let's \\nmake sure that we don't close more bases only because we have a \\nschedule to keep. Prudence requires us to be careful that we are not \\ncutting something we will wish we had kept open. Buying it back 10 \\nyears from now will cost much more, possibly both in terms of money and \\nAmerican lives on the battlefield.\\n  I urge my colleagues to examine the myth of base closure. We are not \\nsaving money. We need to wait, catch our breath and figure out where \\nthe world is going. If there is a remote chance that in 10 years we \\nwill be forced to recreate a military presence which we closed in \\nhaste, we will have to pay a premium price for that presence. We need \\nto wait, catch our breath and figure out where the world is \\ngoing.\\n                                 ______\\n\\n      By Mr. DOLE (for himself and Mr. Lieberman):\\n  S. 2113.

A bill to provide for the payment to States of plot \\nallowances for certain veterans eligible for burial in a national \\ncemetery who are buried in cemeteries of such States; to the Committee \\non Veterans Affairs.\\n\\n\\n                  veterans plot allowance act of 1994\\n\\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, over a decade ago, Congress \\nestablished the state cemetery grant program. This program, under which \\nthe Federal Government provides grants to states for establishing and \\nmaintaining state veterans cemeteries, was enacted in lieu of building \\nadditional national veterans cemeteries.\\n  As part of the program, the Federal Government not only provides \\ngrants to states, it also pays the states a $150 plot allowance for \\neach eligible veteran that is buried free of charge in a State-owned \\nveterans cemetery. This Federal-State partnership has worked well.\\n  However, when it comes to the plot allowance, there is a catch: \\nStates do not always receive it. A State is eligible for the plot \\nallowance payment only if the veteran meets certain criteria. The State \\nreceives the plot allowance only for veterans who: First, were \\nreceiving veterans disability compensation or a veterans pension; \\nsecond, died in a VA hospital; third, were indigent, and the body was \\nunclaimed; or fourth, were, or could have been, discharged from the \\nmilitary due to a disability. At the same time, eligibility for burial \\nin a national veterans cemetery is generally open to all honorably \\ndischarged veterans, space permitting.\\n  In other words, State-owned veterans cemeteries exist to relieve the \\nfederal government of the responsibility of building additional \\nnational veterans cemeteries. Yet, States do not receive the $150 plot \\nallowance for burying all national cemetery eligible veterans. I \\nbelieve this disparate treatment is in conflict with the very purpose \\nfor which state veterans cemeteries were established.\\n  That is why I am introducing legislation today to correct this \\ndisparity. The purpose of my bill is simple: to pay a state the $150 \\nplot allowance for burying without charge any veteran eligible for \\nburial in a national veterans cemetery.\\n  With this proposal, states would receive plot allowance payments for \\nabout 5,000 additional veterans each year. Preliminary estimates from \\nthe Congressional Budget Office indicate the annual cost of the \\nlegislation would be $1 million.\\n  Mr. President, this is not an arcane and trivial matter. Several \\nstates have already threatened to stop burying veterans without charge \\nunless the state is reimbursed for the cost of the plot. And, as more \\nand more national cemeteries are closed to additional burials because \\nof space limitations--in fact, by the end of the decade, more than half \\nof all national veterans cemeteries will be closed--the state veterans \\ncemetery system takes on increased responsibility and increased \\nimportance.\\n  If we are to ensure that America's veterans--the men and women who so \\nbravely fought for our country--are given the opportunity for a decent \\nand dignified national burial, we must ensure that there is a place to \\nbury them. To do that, we must pass the legislation I am introducing \\ntoday, and I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this measure.\\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill and \\nletters of endorsement from the American Legion and AMVETS be printed \\nat this point in the Record.\\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \\nthe Record, as follows:\\n\\n                                S. 2114\\n\\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \\n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\\n\\n     SECTION 1.

Joseph R. Biden, Jr.\\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\\n       The American Legion appreciates the opportunity to comment \\n     on the draft legislation for the payment to States of plot \\n     allowances for certain veterans eligible for burial in a \\n     national cemetery who are buried in cemeteries of such \\n     States.\\n       The draft legislation to be introduced is similar to H.R. \\n     949, legislation passed by the House which will provide a \\n     $150 plot allowance to all veterans buried in State veterans' \\n     cemeteries who are eligible for burial in a national \\n     cemetery. The American Legion supported this proposal in \\n     testimony on March 4, 1993, before the Subcommittee on \\n     Veterans Affairs, U.S. House of Representatives. Unlike the \\n     House legislation, the Senate bill clarifies that the plot \\n     allowance is to be paid to states even in cases of veterans \\n     who die of service-connected disabilities, if they are buried \\n     without charge.\\n       The State Cemetery Grants Program was designed to aid \\n     states in establishing, expanding or improving state-owned \\n     cemeteries for veterans. As further federal funding for the \\n     expansion of national cemeteries is uncertain in the current \\n     budgetary climate, more incentive has to be provided to the \\n     states for continued participation in the State Cemetery \\n     Grants Program. Contained within The American Legion position \\n     on veterans' burial benefits is for a plot allowance to be \\n     paid to the States for any honorably discharged veteran. We \\n     strongly support the continuation and expansion of the State \\n     Cemetery Grants Program, and believe the draft legislation \\n     will enhance this goal.\\n       Attached is The American Legion's testimony concerning H.R. \\n     949.

Joseph R.

It is \\n     incumbent upon the federal government to provide some \\n     assistance to ensure state cemeteries are maintained in an \\n     appropriate manner and AMVETS therefore supports your draft \\n     legislation.\\n       As always Senator, AMVETS appreciates your support for \\n     veterans issues and we look forward to working with you in \\n     the future.\\n           Sincerely,\\n                                                  James J.

A joint resolution to designate 1995 the ``Year of the \\nGirl Child''; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\\n\\n\\n             year of the girl child, 1995 joint resolution\\n\\n Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, girls are the most neglected \\nand undervalued resource worldwide. Gender inequality exists in the \\nUnited States and around the world.\\n  In many cultures, young girls are routinely denied family resources \\nso that there is more for the boys. In China, many family planning \\ndecisions are made based on gender; in India, girls are sold and denied \\na place in the family; in Africa, girls are subjected to genital \\nmutilation. In many parts of the world, girls receive less by virtue of \\nthe power dynamic in the society.\\n  Recognition of the value of girls must begin within individual \\nfamilies and communities. Opening opportunities for the education and \\nemployment of girls and women is vital to achieving success in economic \\nand social development.\\n  Mr. President, I am introducing this joint resolution to call \\nattention to this situation. Women in the United States have a common \\nchallenge with women throughout the world. We must change things here, \\nin our culture, and make things better for girls and women all over the \\nworld. We must work together to change the dynamic of the equation \\nbetween powerlessness and gender, between poverty and gender, between \\nexclusion from decisionmaking and gender. We need to turn that around, \\nso that our entire community worldwide will have the benefit of the \\nparticipation and the energy and intelligence that women have to bring \\nto the table.\\n  This joint resolution will create greater awareness of the conditions \\nunder which girls live around the globe. But it is more than a symbolic \\ngesture. This measure authorizes and requests the President of the \\nUnited States to call upon all U.S. missions in foreign countries, as \\nwell as all United States diplomatic personnel, the Secretary of \\nEducation, and the Secretary of Health and Human Services to encourage \\ngender equality in education, health care, and all phases of family and \\ncommunity life.\\n  I am pleased that more than fifty Senators have signed on as original \\ncosponsors of this joint resolution. Passing this joint resolution \\ndemonstrates that the United States Congress recognizes the plight of \\nthe girl child in the world today. Elevating the status of girls is a \\nfirst step toward raising the status of women, which is, in turn, \\nfundamental to balancing the world's population, environment and \\nresources, and enhancing the quality of life for women and men.\\n                                 ______\\n\\n           By Mr. ROTH:\\n  S.J.

Mr. President, today I am introducing a joint \\nresolution to designate October, 1994 as ``National Decorative Painting \\nMonth.'' Companion legislation was introduced in the House by \\nCongressman Geren in March.\\n  The Society of Decorative Painters has 33,000 members who are located \\nin every State. The membership encompasses a variety of people who \\ncontribute their talents to this field, including teachers, designers, \\nand people who promote our history and culture through decorative \\npainting. American crafts contribute to our economy. The market in \\ncrafts has reached $90 million a year.\\n  The Society of Decorative Painters have given unselfishly of their \\ntime. The society has decorated the Christmas trees at Blair House \\nsince 1983, have decorated Christmas trees for the Smithsonian, and \\nhave donated ornaments at the request of vice-president Gore to be \\npresented as our national gift to Helmut Kohl.\\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce this joint resolution to pay \\ntribute to the Society of Decorative Painters today.
